"ROCKWOOD, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Four generations of Saylors have worked the family's dairy farm for nearly a century, but for the past three years, the cows have been doing something besides providing milk: They've been helping power the place. ""The farm used to get a lot of complaints,"" says farmer Shawn Saylor. ""It used to stink a lot."" Growing up on the sprawling spread 90 minutes from Pittsburgh, 36-year-old farmer Shawn Saylor developed into a self-described science buff. So it was no surprise that, when faced with rising energy costs, Saylor turned to technology. He tapped into an abundant and easily accessible energy source: manure from about 600 cows.  Watch how cow poo powers the farm » . ""It's a pretty simple process. There's not really a lot to it,"" Saylor said. ""Manure comes from the cows, and there's energy left in the manure."" The process is known as anaerobic digestion, and here's how it works: . With the help of a mechanical scraper in the barn, manure drops into a 19,000-gallon tank. The slurry then moves into the digester, which is 16 feet deep and 70 feet in diameter. It's heated there for about 16 days while the bacteria break down the organic matter in order to produce methane gas. That gas is burned in two engine generators to make electricity.  See an interactive explaining the process » . Heat created by the generators keeps the digester hot, heats the buildings around the farm and helps provide hot water. The electricity is used to power this farm and a dozen neighboring homes, Saylor said. And there's still some left over, which he sells back to the grid. Overall, the poo power helps Saylor's bottom line. ""In savings, there's $200,000 a year, in either extra income from sale of electricity or cost offsets,"" he said. ""So you're talking about system project costs of over a million dollars to build the system but a payback of five years or less."" Before he installed the system, the pungent smell from the cows could linger for three to four days, Saylor said. ""The farm used to get a lot of complaints from motorists, which is understandable. It used to stink a lot."" Now, the digesters reduce 98 percent of all odor, although he admits that if the wind blows, you still ""get a whiff."" The farm's leftover solid waste is sold to the community. ""We use it for bedding for the animals,"" according to Saylor. ""A lot of people like to get it for their gardens ... because it doesn't smell much."" Farm-based digesters became popular in the United States during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s. But the technology didn't catch on, possibly because of the high operational costs and declining energy prices, according to the Department of Agriculture. Although Saylor had been interested in digesters for years, his dream didn't become reality until 2006. That's when he received a $600,000 grant from Pennsylvania's Department of Environmental Protection. But Saylor's work isn't done. He intends to make his farm entirely self-sufficient by using waste vegetable oil to make biodiesel fuel. He said his goal is to waste nothing. ""In a biodiesel system, all the waste products can either be used or fed back into the digester to make more gas,"" he said. ""I've always looked at new technologies and believed you kind of have to work with that stuff to stay with the future.""","Interlacing an intricate narrative anchored in the fields of agriculture, energy, and innovation, this article reflects on the experiences and ventures of a farmer - a passionate dispenser of scientific exploration. With an inherent fondness for grappling with the challenges of an ever-evolving world, our protagonist taps into unconventional resources, resulting in significant financial savings as well as community benefits. Exemplifying the adage of 'necessity is the mother of invention', this narrative paints a vivid portrayal of resilience, ingenuity, and sustainable adaptation.","Pennsylvania farmer Shawn Saylor transforms cow manure into electricity through anaerobic digestion on his multi-generational dairy farm, reducing odors and utility costs. The 'poo power' system, a mix of biology and technology, not only powers the farm and several neighboring homes but any surplus is sold back to the grid, yielding $200,000 per year in income and cost savings. Saylor's sustainable energy use story epitomizes the innovative spirit and technological resilience of modern farming.","Shawn Saylor, a farmer from Pennsylvania, harnesses the potential of cow dung through anaerobic digestion, generating electricity and mitigating foul smell. His farm and a number of homes nearby benefit from this renewable source of energy, with excess sold to the grid, generating around $200,000 annually in income and cost savings. His approach is a testament to the empowering blend of traditional farming wisdom and cutting-edge technology.","Shawn Saylor's Pennsylvania farm generates electricity and reduces odor through anaerobic digestion of cow dung, powering the farm and nearby homes.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- A Spaniard has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the fifth such death in Spain since 2005, the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Friday. The victim died in January in the northern city of Santander, according to the statement, which did not provide further details. The victim was a woman who was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. The ministry reiterated that there is no danger from eating meat in Spain. ""The appearance of these sporadic cases is within the predictions that were made at the European level more than nine years ago,"" the ministry statement said. Ten years can pass between eating contaminated tissue and the appearance of the human form of the disease also called variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, health officials say. The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. Three of Spain's five deaths from the disease were in the northern province of Leon. The city of Santander is in the nearby Cantabria province. Last September, officials reported the death of a woman from the human form of mad cow disease. Officials also said her son had died earlier from the same disease. It was believed to have been the first case in the world where two members of the same family have died from the disease, Badiola told CNN at the time. The mother, in her early 60s, died in August 2008. Her son, 41, died in February 2008, Badiola said. Badiola said it was the mother and son likely contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in Spain in 2001. The mother and son had similar eating habits, Badiola said, which included eating animal organs, such as kidneys and livers, and they may also have eaten animal brains. The mother and son were from a village in Leon province. The third fatality in that province was a woman, 50, a local government worker, who died in December 2007. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid.","The given article serves as a detailed narrative on a particular incident involving the unfortunate passing of an individual as a result of a certain health condition.

"A new study has found that lowering the hemlines on school uniforms could reduce the risk of skin cancer. The research, which comes from James Cook University in Queensland, found that increasing the average uniform covering to the knees and elbows could increase sun protection by over 9 per cent. The study included 100 schools in northern Queensland, and found that most schools had uniforms that only covered a small portion of the upper leg and arms, reports ABC.

The study included 100 schools in northern Queensland, and found that most schools had uniforms that only covered a small portion of the upper leg and arms . Katie Clift, a spokesperson for Queensland Cancer, said the alterations 'don't require a re-design of the uniform, just small alterations or choosing loose-fitting garments, so it's a big gain for a little effort. The study also found that students from educationally poor schools wore less protecting school uniforms. Queensland currently has the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with 3000 melanoma and 133,000 non-melanoma skin cancers diagnosed across the state yearly. One school, Magnetic Island State School, has restyled its uniforms to abide by the study. Ms Clift, is encouraging other schools to follow in the steps of Magnetic Island.

"Rapist footballer Ched Evans is considering quitting the game and pursuing a new career as a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been claimed.

Rapist footballer Ched Evans (pictured left and right) is considering quitting the game and becoming a painter decorator after being snubbed by two clubs, it has been reported . Now reports have emerged that he is considering ditching the game altogether and setting up his own business. He completed a decorating course while he was in jail and now wants to make use of his new skills, the Daily Star reports. Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission. The newspaper quotes a source as saying: 'His earnings used to top £20,000 a week at Sheffield United and now he is scrambling around looking for a club in the lower divisions. 'An outfit like Tranmere would pay about £2,000 a week - and even they don't want him. 'He is thinking he might be better off giving up on football and building a business.' Evans was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association. Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds. A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated.

Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned.

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador has criticized the two-year suspension he received for doping -- and has vowed to return to cycling in August even stronger than before. On Monday, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) found Contador guilty of taking banned substance clenbuterol, although they also ruled that the Spaniard did not ingest it intentionally and was likely a victim of a contaminated food supplement. But the 29-year-old, who addressed a packed press conference at a hotel in his home town of Pinto, just south of Madrid, said he was disgusted with the outcome and protested his innocence. ""I am going to continue cycling,"" said Contador. ""I am going to continue practicing it cleanly, the way I have my entire life. ""My mood right now is not the best but I know this will make me stronger in the future,"" added Contador, who blamed contaminated steak for his positive test. He continued: ""Anyone who reads the decision will clearly see that I did not take drugs. The hardest thing has been to see the suffering my family has been through."" Contador's positive test related to the 2010 Tour de France, which he won by just 39 seconds ahead of Luxembourg's Andy Schleck. It was made public by Contador himself in August 2010, with the two-year ban backdated to that announcement, meaning he can resume racing in seven months.

He will miss this year's Giro, Tour and Olympic Games. However, he will be eligible for the 2012 Tour of Spain, a race he won in 2008, and for the world championships in Limburg, Netherlands. Contador would not elaborate on his future racing plans, saying: ""I still don't know what my program will be after my suspension. ""I have to organize my future but that does not depend only on me.

"There is something wild about actress Melanie Griffith's upbringing. As this incredible series of photographs shows, while her peers were growing up, fighting with their parents and doing everything else a normal teenager does, the 14-year-old Griffith had an extra influence at home - her enormous, live-in pet lion. Pictured in 1971 lounging by the pool, playfighting, and even in bed together, Melanie and Neil, as the hulking African big cat was known, can be seen sharing a touching bond. Neil came to live with the family in bizarre circumstances, after they adopted him from Anton Lavey, High Priest of the Church of Satan, who was told he could no longer keep him in his small San Francisco apartment.

Griffith, the daughter of starlet and Hitchcock muse Tippi Hedren, lived with her mother and her then-husband Noel Marshall, a Hollywood agent. In the series of pictures, first published in LIFE Magazine, Marshall and Hedren are also seen happily co-existing with Neil.

In total, despite its $17million price-tag, the film only made $2million at the box office. But the movie stands as a testament to the family's love of lions - which Hedren still keeps at her home on a wildlife reserve in California.

"DENVER, Colorado (CNN) -- A former hospital employee may have exposed hundreds, or even thousands, of surgical patients to hepatitis C after taking their fentanyl injections and replacing them with used syringes filled with saline solution, authorities say. A hospital worker has admitted to secretly injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Kristen Diane Parker, who worked at Rose Medical Center in Denver, has admitted to secretly injecting herself in a bathroom and using unclean syringes as replacements for patients, investigators said. She had hepatitis C, which she believes she contracted through using heroin and sharing dirty needles while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. She was a surgical technician at Rose from October 2008 to April 2009. Nine patients who had surgery there during that time have tested positive for hepatitis C. Investigators are looking into whether they contracted the virus from Parker.

She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker quit after she was found to be in an operating room where she was not allowed to be. She subsequently tested positive for fentanyl. Hospital officials then contacted the DEA. Parker is in federal custody facing three drug-related charges. If she is found to have done serious harm to a patient, she could face up to 20 years in prison. If a patient dies because of her actions, she could face life in prison. In a statement to police, Parker said, ""I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else."" Her attorney could not be reached Friday. Rose Medical Center is contacting 4,700 patients who had surgery at Rose during the time Parker was employed there. However, hospital officials do not believe that many patients were exposed.

"Geneva, Switzerland (CNN) -- Guardedly positive tones were sounded Tuesday as Iran and six world powers met in Geneva for the first of two days of talks about Iran's nuclear ambitions -- talks conducted amid a spirit of new optimism since President Hassan Rouhani took office this summer. Iran, which wants the six powers to recognize what it says is the peaceful nature of its nuclear energy pursuits, laid out confidential proposals in the morning. A spokesman for the European Union's foreign policy chief called the presentation ""very useful."" The two-day talks in Geneva bring together Iran's representatives with those from the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, all countries with permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany. Talks continued in the afternoon, and will resume on Wednesday. ""For the first time, we had very detailed technical discussions,"" a senior U.S. State Department official said. Ahead of the talks: U.S. hopeful but 'clear-eyed' Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, who is taking a lead role in the negotiations, said Tuesday that the ""negotiation's environment was positive,"" according to Iran's semi-official Fararu news agency. Many in the West fear Iran is pursuing the development of a nuclear bomb, but Iran -- slapped with sanctions because of its program -- has always maintained that it is developing nuclear energy capabilities for peaceful purposes only. European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton is chairwoman for the talks for the P5+1 bloc, while Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is leading the Iranian delegation. Ahead of Tuesday's meeting, Zarif said he hoped that together, Iran and the West would be able to work out a ""road map"" toward a final resolution by Wednesday. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann, said that the mood was one of ""cautious optimism"" but that the ""ball is in Iran's court"" to respond to the bloc's concerns. The P5+1 bloc put forward its own proposals at a meeting with Iran in Kazakhstan in the spring, and these remain on the table, Mann told reporters earlier. 'Verifiably proven' The talks, which are being conducted in English for the first time, are due to last two days, but the timetable is fluid, Mann said. ""We have said we want Iran to engage constructively with proposals we have put forward. Or, if they want to, they can come up with their own proposals,"" he said. ""What matters is the end result -- that they address the international community's concerns about the purely peaceful nature of the Iranian nuclear program. ""We have to reach a situation at the end where they have proven, and verifiably proven, that there is no nuclear military program. That is the end result that is being sought."" The Iranians' PowerPoint presentation, laid out in English, was titled ""Closing Unnecessary Crisis, Opening New Horizons."" Araqchi said Iran's goal is to guarantee its citizens' rights to ""enjoy nuclear energy, including enrichment, along with the verification of its peaceful program,"" according to the Fararu news agency. Critics have expressed suspicions about Iran's uranium enrichment, fearing that Iran may secretly be transforming nuclear fuel into atomic bomb-grade materials. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Rouhani's visit culminated in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama and a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Zarif. Iran nuclear talks are key topic as Obama, Netanyahu meet . It was the first such high-level contact between the two sworn enemies since Iran's 1979 revolution, which sent relations between the two into a deep freeze. Israel: Don't relax sanctions too early . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged the international community not to relax too soon the painful economic sanctions that have put Iran's leaders under ""intense pressure"" to return to talks. ""I think it would be a historic mistake to ease the sanctions when they are so close to achieving their goals,"" he said. ""Now is an opportune moment to reach a genuine diplomatic solution that peacefully ends Iran's military nuclear program. ""This opportunity can only be realized if the international community continues to place pressure on Iran, because it is that pressure that has brought Iran back to the negotiations in the first place. And it is that pressure which makes the peaceful dismantling of Iran's military nuclear program possible."" Iran's president: We're open to nuclear talks, but don't make threats . Israel's Security Cabinet also warned Tuesday against conceding too much too soon to the Iranians. ""Israel does not oppose Iran having peaceful nuclear energy. This does not require uranium enrichment or plutonium. Iran's nukes prog does,"" Netanyahu spokesman Ofir Gendelman said via Twitter. Could Revolutionary Guards sabotage Iran-U.S. thaw? A country that ""regularly deceives the international community"" does not have a ""right to enrich"" as Iran claims, he said. A senior Obama administration official told reporters in Geneva that the administration would be willing to consider quick relief on sanctions ""targeted in proportion"" to what Iran puts on the table, should it be prepared to curtail the pace and scope of its uranium enrichment program, offer steps to improve transparency of its nuclear program, and address concerns about its stockpile of enriched uranium. Larijani: 'We are ready' Ali Larijani, Iran's powerful parliamentary speaker and a close associate of the nation's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said last week that Iran is serious about resolving the dispute over its nuclear program. It is keen to resolve the issue ""in a short period of time,"" Larijani told CNN's Christiane Amanpour in an exclusive interview from Geneva. ""From Iran's side, I can say that we are ready,"" he said. Rouhani: Nuclear weapons have no place in Iran's security . ""If the Americans and other countries say that Iran should not develop a nuclear bomb or should not move towards that, then we can clearly show and prove that. We have no such intention. So it can be resolved in a very short period of time."" Nonetheless, Larijani said, the West must accept Iran's right to enrich nuclear fuel for civilian purposes, as allowed under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, to which Iran is a signatory. Building trust . Some believe that Iran's recent apparent willingness to negotiate seriously over its nuclear program is a result of the crippling sanctions on its economy. Shortly after this year's U.N. General Assembly ended, a U.S. State Department official said the United States would be prepared to consider relaxing certain sanctions on Iran if it took confidence-building steps to prove its sincerity to negotiate over its nuclear program. But this will take time and the building of trust. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, who is in Geneva, stressed that the entire sanctions regime targeting Iran would not be lifted ""any time soon"" unless the array of concerns about Iran's nuclear program was fully addressed.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Water flowed on the surface of Mars as recently as 200,000 years ago, new research suggests. A young crater in the red planet's southern hemisphere contains well-preserved gullies and sediment deposits thought to have been formed by water. Scientists studying the crater estimated it to be no more than about 200,000 years old, so the water features must have appeared since then, the scientists claim. Scroll down for video... This photo shows debris flowing on Mars (top and bottom left). The Martian landforms were shown to be similar to  known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean (bottom right) The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. ‘Gullies are common on Mars but the ones which have been studied previously are older, and the sediments where they have formed are associated with the most recent ice age,’ said lead scientist Dr Andreas Johnsson, from the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. ‘Our study crater on Mars is far too young to have been influenced by the conditions that were prevalent then. The crater formed long after the most recent proposed ice age on Mars, which ended some 400,000 years ago. This is an artist's impression of what a lake on Mars may have looked like .

Viking orbiters that followed caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars by showing how floods broke through dams and carved deep valleys. Mars is currently in the middle of an ice age, so liquid water cannot exist on its surface at the present time. However, the planet seems to have been warmer and wetter in the past. In June last year, Curiosity found Powerful evidence that water good enough to drink once flowed on Mars. In September, the first scoop of soil analysed by Curiosity revealed that fine materials on the surface of the planet contain two per cent water by weight. ‘This suggests that the melt water-related processes that formed these deposits have been exceptionally effective also in more recent times.’ The crater had features that were characteristic of debris flows on Earth caused by material being carried and then deposited by fast-moving water. The Martian landforms were compared with known debris flows on the Norwegian Svalbard islands in the Arctic Ocean. ‘Our fieldwork on Svalbard confirmed our interpretation of the Martian deposits,’ said Dr Johnsson, whose findings appear in the scientific journal Icarus. ‘What surprised us was that the crater in which these debris flows have formed is so young.’ The study crater is located in the mid-latitudes of the Martian southern hemisphere and superimposed on the ‘rampart ejecta’ of a nearby larger crater. Rampart ejecta, which display flower-like features, are believed to be the result of a meteor impact on wet or icy ground. The scientists first thought the recent water flow features had come from preserved ice within the rampart ejecta. However, structures such as faults or fractures that could have acted as conduits for the melt water were missing. ‘It is more likely that the water has come from melting snow packs, when the conditions were favourable for snow formation,’ said Dr Johnsson. ‘This is possible since the orbital axis of Mars was more tilted in the past than it is today.’ Evidence of water on Mars dates back . to the Mariner 9 mission, which arrived in 1971.

"PR puss: The Camerons are said to be annoyed that people see the cat as something of a gimmick . David Cameron tonight addressed the nation on the big political issue of the day: does he hate Larry the Cat. According to a new book, the claws are out for the pet hired to catch mice in the corridors of power. But in the midst of a growing political storm and a Twitter campaign to ’Save Larry’, even the Prime Minister had to resort to a pun, insisting they all get on ’purr-fectly well’.

Ian Fleming wanted his first James Bond film to feature Mafia villains and be as fast-paced as possible to distract the audience from unlikely storylines, a previously unseen memo reveals. The message from the author, written in 1958, warned against any 'cardboard' acting and suggested the script writers should use an Italian phone directory to make the names as authentic as possible. While the Mafia did not feature in a Bond film, the plot ultimately formed the basis for the Thunderball movie, though with significant changes. No cardboard: This memo, written by Ian Fleming to Jack Whittingham in 1958, outlines the plot for a Bond film which would eventually become Thunderball . Memo: Ian Fleming, pictured, sent the suggested to playwright Jack Whittingham . Differences between the original script . and the Thunderball familiar to fans include dropping the Mafia villains . in favour of global terrorist group SPECTRE, and changing Bond's love . interest from straight-laced police investigator to a fiery, . sexually-aware young woman called Domino. He sent the page-long summary of ideas for the film - which had suggested titles of James Bond, Secret Agent, and later Longitude 78 West - to playwright Jack Whittingham, who was tasked with producing the first 007 screenplay. A secret memo in which Mr Fleming spells out his ideas for the first James Bond movie including using names from the phonebook for characters has come to light. The correspondences predates Dr No, the first Bond film to make it to cinemas, by four years. Although a final script was made for the film, it never went into production due to a legal wrangle. Along with the memo is a final edition bound script for Thunderball, which will be sold at auction in London this month. The items were held by Mr Whittingham, who died in 1972, and have now been made available by his estate. In his memo the prolific novelist outlined the plot, involving the Mafia blackmailing the British out of £100million pounds using a stolen nuclear warhead. Final cut: The script developed by Mr Fleming and Whittingham eventually became the film Thunderball, starring Sean Connery (pictured) Mr Fleming wrote: 'My concern is... to make it as fast-moving and packed with incidents as possible. To my mind the chief weakness is the thinness of the Mafia threat and this must be considerably strengthened. 'I am badly in need of good Italian names for the Mafia gangsters and these could perhaps be obtained from the Venice telephone directory! 'In order to keep the feet of this film firmly on the ground production will have to be particularly brisk so as not to allow the audience time to worry about probabilities. 'Production will have to be particularly strong in portraying the Secret Service and the Mafia. Any suspicion of cardboard must be avoided and the acting throughout should be under-played and without exaggeration. 'More subsidiary incidents should be added where there is any sign of the pace flagging but, for the time being, my invention has run out.' Novel: Mr Fleming later turned the script into a . novel (right) but did not credit Mr Whittingham or his producer, who . had helped craft it. A court case later awarded Mr Whittingham the film . rights to the book. The finished screenplay, right, is part of the . auction lot . Although the scrip was finalised, plans for the film were shelved in 1960 due to a disagreement with producer Kevin McClory. Mr Fleming went on to write Thunderball as a novel in 1961, but in doing so failed to credit Whittingham and McClory for their input. The case was settled out of court in November 1963 and McClory was awarded the film rights for Thunderball, which premiered in 1965, a year after Fleming's death. The memo along with a first draft 'continuity treatment' for Thunderball by Whittingham, and first draft shooting script for the film that are all for sale now were used as evidence in the case. Katherine Schofield, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'Fleming decided in 1958 to turn one of his James Bond books into a film and this pre-dated Dr No by four years. Titles: Pages of the memo up for auction show potential titles for the film which would become Thunderball . 'The memo is Fleming's thoughts of what the film would be. He was an amazing novelist but found it difficult to convert his work to the big screen which is why he employed Whittingham. 'Fleming is saying in the memo ""let's do it like this"". One idea he had was to use the Mafia as the bad guys which is different to what was eventually made. 'But the most significant item for sale is the original final edition script because that is the script for the very first Bond movie.' The memo, Whittingham's first draft treatment and first draft shooting script are expected to sell for £5,000 each. The final edition script for Thunderball is tipped to go under the hammer for £12,000 in the auction in London on December 18.","The subject of this article is an intriguing examination of the history of the James Bond saga, as seen through the lens of previously undiscovered correspondences involving author Ian Fleming.

"(CNN) -- My name is Evan Moss and I'm a 9-year-old boy who likes Pokemon! A lot! When I was 1 month old I started having seizures, and when I was 4 years old I went to Dr. Weiner and he gave me brain surgery to stop my seizures. It stopped my seizures for two years but not my appetite, it just kept on growing! It is still growing. After two years my seizures came back and now they are longer. When was little I had like 15 small seizures a day. Now I have 10-minute seizures but I only have one every 14 days or so. I have two dogs. One is Dinky and the other is Mindy. Dinky is our family dog and he really belongs to my sister, Aria. Mindy is my seizure dog. Getting Mindy took a long time. We had to raise a lot of money and wait almost a year to meet her and then we had to drive from Virginia to Ohio to get Mindy. Having Mindy is very fun! When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn't listen to me, but now she does and she knows a lot of commands. I've even taught her some new things, like climbing up into the fort section of my swing set. The best thing about having Mindy is playing with her and I love racing with her. If she is on her leash she runs right next to me but I know she can run really fast. I have epilepsy but I can do some extraordinary things like ride a zip line! Epilepsy can also be bad, though, and I've heard about some seizures that can kill you! Sometimes I worry that will happen to me but I don't think about that too much, plus I have Mindy to help me. Mindy barks when I have a seizure so my parents will know. When I have a seizure, my mom and dad give me medicine to help stop the seizure. People ask me a lot what it feels like but it's hard to describe and sometimes I don't remember having a seizure. If I met someone who just found out they have epilepsy I'd say, ""Don't worry, you're not in this alone!""","This particular piece of written work explores and discusses the journey of a young lad named Evan Moss, plagued by seizures from a very tender age, but not devoid of life's little joys. The enthusiast in him resonates with his affection towards Pokemon and playful demeanor with his dogs, especially Mindy, who assists him during seizure episodes.

"By . Eve Mcgowan . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 14 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:00 EST, 14 December 2013 . To anyone under the age of 40, Paul Elliott is instantly recognisable as one half of the Chuckle Brothers, children’s TV favourites from 1987 onwards. With Paul playing straight man to his hapless older brother Barry, the pair made  an impressive 21 series of their hit BBC show Chucklevision, famous for its slapstick humour and catchphrases such as ‘to me, to you’. They filmed their last series in 2009, making it the longest running sitcom after Last Of The Summer Wine. Regular at this pub: Chuckle Brother Paul Elliot in the bar at his home 'Half Acre' in Hatfield, Doncaster, South Yorkshire . With their success came all the trappings, and Paul’s five-bedroom gated home, Half Acres – with its well-stocked bar room, snooker room and grounds of one-and-a-half acres – is testimony to this. Set in the pleasant village of Hatfield in South Yorkshire, Half Acres is a 15-minute drive from Doncaster and not far from Rotherham, where Paul and Barry grew up in a council house with their two older brothers and their parents – mum Amy and father James, a gang show performer. However,  you could say that Paul has become a victim of his own success. The palatial house, set down a private road, has been on the market for nearly two years. Despite reducing the asking price by £150,000 to £550,000, he has yet to find a buyer. ‘We’ve had only four or five viewings in all that time,’ says Paul, who believes the house may be just too expensive for local buyers. ‘The average house price around here is in the region of £95,000; we’re charging more than five times that.’ Hard sell: Mr Elliot has been forced to lower the price for the home with £150,000 to £550,000 as he struggles to find a buyer . In frustration, he has just changed estate agents. According to Julian Brown, director at Portfield, Garrard and Wright, Paul’s new agents, it has been a tough few years for prices in the region. He explains that prices have yet to recover to pre-2008 levels but things are starting to look up. ‘Last month was cracking, our best in four years,’ he says, ‘but there are few buyers in Paul’s price range and because it’s such a unique property, it has to find its own level.’ Paul’s material possessions have been hard won. This is the Chuckle Brothers’ 50th year as a double act – they found fame after winning the TV talent show New Faces in 1974 – and the pair have just embarked on their 46th panto run, in Darlington. Although both in their late 60s, the brothers show no sign of slowing down and spend their time travelling around the country for personal appearances at everything from pub quizzes to corporate team-building events, as well as touring with their own show. ‘I can’t imagine retiring because it’s such good fun,’ says Paul. Chuckling away: The five-bedroom home also has a snooker table and an en-suite master bedroom . He admits the panto season – two performances a day, six days a week until February – is pretty exhausting. ‘It’s not an easy life but it’s better than going down the pit,’ says Paul, whose first job was working in a Sheffield steelworks. Paul and wife Sue, 56, bought Half Acres for £300,000 in 2002 and have spent about £50,000 extending it, adding a master bedroom suite with bathroom and dressing room. Now that their youngest two sons are in their early 20s, they are keen to downsize and plan to spend much of the year at their Brittany farmhouse. Despite struggling to sell his current home, Paul still thinks property is a good place to invest his money. ‘Obviously I’m not happy about having to reduce the price but we will still have made money on the house if we sell for the new asking price.’ The couple decided to invest in other properties soon after moving to Half Acres. They built a five-bedroom villa with pool on the Greek island of Kefalonia, which they rent to holidaymakers, and own a two-bedroom apartment on the island, where they themselves holiday. They have also bought a two-bed apartment in Calabria, Italy, which they visit twice a year. portfieldgarrard.com .","This article discusses the life and career of Paul Elliot, a prominent children's television actor best known for his role in the famous 'Chuckle Brothers'.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The election of 736 members from 27 member countries to the European Parliament in June will be the biggest transnational electoral contest there has ever been.  Between them they will represent more than 500,000,000 people. About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote. But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Here are answers to the most frequently asked questions about the contest. Who will be voting, when and where? About 375 million EU citizens aged 18 or over are entitled to vote in the election of the parliament members for a five-year term. The elections will be held on Thursday, June 4 in the UK and the Netherlands. There will be voting on Friday, June 5 in Ireland and the Czech Republic. And it will begin on Saturday, June 6 in Cyprus, France, Italy, Latvia, Malta and Slovakia. The other countries will conduct their voting on Sunday, June 7. Elections will take place in all 27 member countries of the EU, with the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania included for the first time. How many MEPs are there and how many does each country elect? There will be 736 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in the new assembly. The number each country has varies according to its population. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. Malta, with a total population of just 410,000, will have only 5. Will that number stay the same if the Lisbon Treaty comes into effect? No. The Lisbon Treaty, designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU (and to increase the powers of the European Parliament,) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland, the only country to give electors a direct voice. But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula. That means that 15 'ghost MEPs', will be elected on June 7, entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through. What election system is used? That varies according to the individual states represented, but all will be using some variant of proportional representation. In some countries candidates will all be on a single national list, making the entire country a constituency. Others elect MEPs from regional constituencies. Many countries set a threshold, insisting that parties have to gain an overall proportion of the vote -- 5 per cent in France and Germany, 4 per cent in Sweden or Austria -- to qualify for any allocation of seats. Whom do the MEPs represent? Most would-be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties. National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates. But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group (PES), the Liberal Group (ELDR) or the European Greens. The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party (EPP). However, David Cameron, the national leader of Britain's Conservatives, has withdrawn his members from the EPP, regarding it as too federalist in its approach. The groups work as a bloc when they can and have ""whips"" designed to make them as cohesive as possible. What powers do the MEPs have? Much legislation in member states actually originates at a European level. National legislatures pass laws which have begun life as directives from the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which the MEPs have helped to shape. They are the only elected part of the European apparatus which is otherwise dominated by European Councils (meetings of the prime ministers or finance or trade or interior ministers from the 27 nations) or the European Commission. Do MEPs really make much difference to ordinary people's lives? It may not feel like it, day to day, but MEPs often have more influence over the shaping of European legislation which filters down to national parliaments than the members of those national parliaments do when the laws get to them. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the ""roaming directive"" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. It was the EU which determined that telephone and data companies had to keep records for at least two years to help counter terrorism . And the so-called ""REACH"" directive has forced businesses to disclose what chemicals they use in their products and to ensure that they are safe. Because driving legislation through the European Parliament requires the building of cross-party coalitions more than 50 percent of amendments proposed in the European Parliament end up as law. That is why company lobbyists spent much time in Brussels trying to make their case to MEPs. But does the Parliament have any muscle? It has the rather drastic power to sack the European Commission. It also holds public hearings on newly-appointed Commissioners. The Parliament also has significant powers over how much of the European Union budget is spent. Although most legislation originates with the Commission, if more than 50 percent of MEPs back a resolution calling for new laws in a particular area the the Commission has to get down to work to propose some. The EU is one of the largest aid donors in the world, dispensing some $15 billion a year across five continents and MEPs have a significant say in that. Where is the European Parliament situated? Most of its meetings are held in Brussels close to the officials whose draft legislation is examined by the Parliament's subject committees. But, at a considerable cost, some plenary meetings are also held in Strasbourg, an arrangement which the French government has fought long and hard to maintain.","This fascinating article disseminates information regarding the imminent electoral contest set to unfold in the European Parliament that covers the pan-European region.

"(CNN)  -- A tugboat on Saturday reached a disabled freighter carrying 22 people, hours after the ship rode out Hurricane Ike without power, Coast Guard spokesman Mike O'Berry said. O'Berry said the tugboat Rotterdam arrived shortly before 2 p.m. (3 p.m. ET). Repairs will be made aboard the Antalina, which has a broken fuel pump, while at sea, O'Berry said. The tugboat will then tow the ship to Port Arthur, Texas, where it will undergo additional repairs and eventually offload more of its cargo -- petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct -- O'Berry said. The crew members aboard the Antalina, a Cypriot-flagged freighter, are all in good health, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Ron Labrec. The freighter suffered no major damage from the storm, said Darrell Wilson, a spokesman for the company that manages the ship. Aircraft from the Coast Guard and Air Force were sent Friday afternoon to try to rescue the crew of the freighter, which is loaded with petroleum coke, a petroleum byproduct. But high winds forced the military to abort the rescue, O'Berry said. The Coast Guard then instructed the freighter to contact it each hour. It also told told the crew to turn on the ship's emergency radio beacon so its position could be monitored, O'Berry said.  Watch the Coast Guard conduct a rescue operation » . Onshore as well, rescuers found it too dangerous to respond to calls for help. In Liverpool, Texas, south of Houston, a family called for help around 1 a.m. Saturday when a tree crashed into their house, but authorities concluded that strong winds made it too dangerous to respond, said Doc Adams, Brazoria County's emergency management coordinator. ""You want to take care of people, and when you can't, it's tough,"" Adams said. ""Unfortunately, someone has to make the decision about whether the risk is worth the benefit. Are you willing to risk three or four lives to save one? It's not easy."" Adams said he didn't know if anyone in the house was hurt. ""As far as I know, they're still there in the house with a tree over it,"" he said at about 3:40 a.m. The stranded freighter had been headed south through the Gulf of Mexico from Port Arthur, Texas, but ""lost main propulsion 90 miles southeast of Galveston"" and was unable to steer, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard received a distress call from the vessel at 4 a.m. Friday. The Antalina was ""basically adrift, at the mercy of the wind and sea currents,"" Coast Guard Petty Officer Tom Atkeson said at the time. ""We are in hell,"" one of the men aboard the freighter told CNN on Friday before the rescue was called off. The man said the winds around the ship were strong but that the freighter still had power. On Friday before the storm hit, authorities picked up more than 120 people stranded by rising seas along the southeast Texas coast. Most of the rescues occurred in Galveston County, where rising water and other effects of the storm began hours before landfall early Saturday. Stranded residents were airlifted from Crystal Beach, Bolivar Peninsula and other communities in the Galveston area. Many of those rescued were motorists stranded on flooded roads. In Surfside Beach, police waded through chest-high rushing water to rescue five people trapped in their homes. One man refused to leave, said Surfside Beach police Chief Randy Smith. ""Some of them took convincing, some of them didn't,"" Smith said. Police also rescued five other people who waded out to meet the officers. About half of those rescues were done by helicopters out of bases along the coast, said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Schulein. Three HH-65C helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Houston rescued more than 20 people and continued to fly rescue missions until weather grounded them Friday evening, said Petty Officer Renee Aiello, a station spokeswoman. Some 37,000 people may need to be rescued in the aftermath of the hurricane, a U.S. military official estimated Friday. Texas already has asked for help, and the active-duty military has 42 search-and-rescue helicopters on standby, the official said.","This article discusses an incident of a freighter being affected by Hurricane Ike leading to a subsequent rescue operation executed by various entities including the Coast Guard.

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- An unusual sight greeted Jerusalem police as they entered one of Christianity's holiest sites Sunday morning: dozens of monks punching and kicking each other in a massive brawl.

Monks from the Greek Orthodox and Armenian denominations were preparing for a ceremony at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City when a disagreement led to a full-fledged fistfight. The fight began when Armenian clergy were holding a procession to commemorate the finding of the cross believed to have been used in the crucifixion of Jesus, according to The Associated Press. The Greek members of the clergy wanted one of their monks present, the AP reported, for fear that the procession would undermine their claim to an ancient structure built on what is believed to be the tomb of Jesus. The two sides could not agree, and when the Armenians tried to begin the procession, the Greek monks stepped in and the fighting began, the AP reported.

"(CNN) -- Depending on who you ask, Crimea's decision to secede from Ukraine was either an unconstitutional split manipulated by Russia or a move consistent with international law upholding the region's right to govern itself. The United States and its European allies say Sunday's referendum vote violated Ukraine's newly reforged constitution and amounts to a thinly veiled attempt by Russia to expand its borders to the Black Sea peninsula under a threat of force. Moscow asserts Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted in an illegal coup, which ended Ukraine's constitutional authority. Russian President Vladimir Putin argues Crimeans should have the right to decide how they want to be governed going forward. So who's right? ""The answer depends on what your perspective is,"" said David Rothkopf, editor of Foreign Policy magazine. ""The U.S. is buying into the argument of the Ukraine government, which is that the secession of Crimea from Ukraine is not constitutional under the terms of the Ukrainian constitution,"" Rothkopf said. ""The alternative argument is that all peoples have a right of self-determination and that if the people of Crimea choose not to be part of Ukraine, that is their prerogative in the same way that it was the choice of colonial powers to break away from the imperial powers that claimed them or parts of the former Yugoslavia were free to head off on their own,"" he added. Ukraine 'will never accept' Crimea annexation, President says . The standoff between the United States and Russia resembles tension from the Cold War era. ""We'll continue to make clear to Russia that further provocations will achieve nothing except to further isolate Russia and diminish its place in the world,"" President Barack Obama said on Monday. ""The international community will continue to stand together to oppose any violations of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity; and continued Russia military intervention in Ukraine will only deepen Russia's diplomatic isolation and exact a greater toll on the Russia economy,"" Obama said. The United States and Europe imposed travel bans and froze assets of senior Russian and Crimean officials. The Obama administration went a step further by banning entry and freezing all U.S. assets held by any Russian government official or people with close financial ties to 11 people, including advisers to Putin. Legal or not, Crimean referendum will shape Ukraine crisis . Separate from the vote, Crimean lawmakers approved a resolution on Monday that declared the Black Sea peninsula an independent, sovereign state and requested to join the Russian Federation. Putin later in the day signed a decree that recognized Crimea's independence, the Kremlin said. He will address a joint session of Parliament on Crimea on Tuesday. Putin spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently by phone and stressed the Crimean referendum was in accordance with international law, including Article 1 of the U.N. Charter regarding the principle of self-determination. ""It was emphasized that Russia will respect the choice of the Crimean people,"" according to a Kremlin statement summarizing that conversation. Obama told Putin during a phone call on Sunday that ""Russia's actions were in violation of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" according to the White House. Putin pushed back, according to a statement from the Kremlin, and said the situation in Crimea is akin to Kosovo's breakaway from Serbia in 2008. ""Regarding the March 16 referendum in Crimea, Mr Putin said that the decision to hold the referendum was in line with international law and the U.N. Charter, and was also in line with the precedent set by Kosovo,"" the Kremlin said. ""The referendum was organized in such a way as to guarantee Crimea's population the possibility to freely express their will and exercise their right to self-determination,"" it said. West hits back at Russians over Crimea . Even within Crimea's pro-Russia majority, opinions about the legality of seceding are split. Voters proudly proclaimed their support for rejoining Russia as they stood in line in dreary weather to vote. However, one, who was too afraid to speak to CNN on camera, proclaimed the referendum illegal. The ethnic Tatars and younger voters have also questioned the legality of secession. Many of the Tatar minority boycotted the referendum with some leaders calling it ""a farce"" forced by armed men. As the United States and Russia attempt to hash out their differences, pressure mounts for Putin to move quickly and carefully in resolving the Crimean crisis, Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute told CNN International. ""He basically has two choices. Choice Number One would be to move fairly quickly to annex Crimea and that is going to then seem as a very naked land grab and will make it very difficult then for a dialogue to move forward,"" Pifer said. ""That move will likely mean Western nations will ratchet up the level of sanctions, Pifer said. ""The alternative is they take the vote but that the Russians don't move very quickly,"" Pifer said. ""They let Crimea basically stay in some limbo status which will create some opportunity perhaps for negotiation that can diffuse this crisis.""

"San Antonio (CNN) -- Clerks scheduling medical appointments for veterans were ""cooking the books"" at their bosses' behest to hide the fact some had to wait weeks, if not months, for appointments, a VA scheduler in San Antonio said Thursday. The Office of Inspector General confirms to CNN that it has staff investigators on the ground in San Antonio looking into the allegations. The allegations surrounding this Texas VA hospital comes as the federal department fends off claims of potentially deadly delays at other facilities, including claims of a secret wait list in Phoenix that was first reported by CNN. Phoenix VA officials deny secret wait list; doctors say they're lying . The VA's official policy is that all patients should be able to see a doctor, dentist or some other medical professional within 14 days of their requested/preferred date. Any wait longer than two weeks is supposed to documented. Yet Brian Turner, a Veterans Affairs scheduling clerk based in San Antonio, said Thursday that some who called to make appointments at his facility did end up waiting longer, yet such delays were never reported. For example, he said, they might be told the next available appointment wasn't for several months. It would be scheduled for then, but marked in official files as if the patient had put off their appointment until then by choice. ""What we've been instructed was that -- they are not saying fudged, there is no secret wait list -- but what they've done is come out and just say 'zero out that date,' "" Turner said. The ""zero,"" in this case, suggests the patient didn't have to wait at all. ""It could be three months and look like no days (wait),"" he added. ""It looked like they had scheduled the appointment and got exactly what they wanted."" The Veterans Affairs public affairs office said that Turner's allegation has been looked into, without any finding of wrongdoing. ""Based on our internal fact-finding conducted April 25-28, we found the claims by this employee were not substantiated,"" the VA statement said. However, the Office of Inspector General says it is conducting its own investigation. Turner tells CNN he has already been interviewed by OIG staff. The claim comes amid strong public pressure on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and its leader, Eric Shinseki, after CNN reporting unveiled e-mails that allegedly discussed the destruction of a secret list of veterans waiting for care at a Phoenix VA hospital. Shinseki has ordered a ""face-to-face audit"" at VA clinics, a department spokesman said on Thursday. Earlier the same day, a House committee voted to subpoena Shinseki in the wake of such accusations that his department is responsible for deadly delays in health care. Shinseki orders 'face-to-face audit' at clinics . Turner told CNN that he's become a witness in an investigation by the VA inspector general's office focusing on delayed care, alleged falsification of records and possible medical harm to veterans at the San Antonio facility. Turner, a former Army soldier himself who still works at the VA, said he has asked to be protected under federal whistle-blower laws. As to the VA's earlier fact-finding efforts, Turner said that no one asked him about his allegations. In fact, he said, when he began expressing his concerns to other staff members, he was called in and told not to e-mail another person. ""They shut me up the very next day,"" Turner said. Newt Gingrich: Vets need and deserve a 21st-century VA . CNN's Drew Griffin and Scott Bronstein reported from San Antonio, and Greg Botelho wrote this story from Atlanta. CNN's Nelli Black contributed to this report.","In a drawn-out chronicle riddled with allegations and subsequent investigation, this piece furthers the dialogue on the supposed scheduling inconsistencies said to be present in a VA facility.

Dead: John Jobson, 22, died six days after his pickup truck was struck by a commuter train, now the railroad is suing his mother for damages . Despite Sharon Jobson, 50, persuading the rail operator to budget over $400,000 to install signs and warning gates at rail crossings, the one her son was killed at still has inadequate signage and no gates, yet the CN Rail felt it proper to serve her with the lawsuit since she is the executor of his estate, according to CTV.John Jobson is ‘wholly responsible’ for costs related to rail repair and a ‘bottleneck of rail traffic,’ according to a copy of the suit obtained by the Toronto Star. The suit goes on to say that Jobson failed to obey a stop sign and was traveling ‘at an excessive rate of speed’ over the rail crossing when his pickup truck was struck by a passenger train, the paper reported. John Jobson died six days later at a local hospital. ‘He created a situation of danger . . . (and) had a history of failing to stop at this crossing,’ the paper reported the suit said.Of the 116 passengers on-board the VIA train, six sustained minor injuries when the locomotive and all four train cars derailed after the collision, according to a report from the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Pay up: CN Rail says negligence caused the collision and that the $500,000 in repairs and inconveniences should be paid by his mother Sharon Jobson . Unsafe: The suit was brought against Sharon Jobson despite the crossing having inadequate signage at the time of the collision that has yet to be upgraded . The history of failing to stop at rail crossings alleged in the suit is an incident in which John Jobson had to drive into a ditch to avoid colliding with a Canadian Pacific Railway train at a separate crossing just north of where the collision occurred, according to the TSB report. Adequate signage and warnings were installed at the CP crossing shortly after the incident, the TSB report noted.Despite a train previously killing a driver in a 1998 collision at the same crossing where John Jobson’s pickup truck was hit, CN Rail neglected to upgrade the crossing’s warning systems, which the TSB said were ‘situated too low,’ to sufficiently warn drivers.Also a hindrance to John Jobson being aware of the oncoming train was the train horn’s position – instead of being at the front of the locomotive, it was in the middle of the head car, making it harder to hear, according to the TSB report. Crushed: Sharon Jobson's son is dead because a train hit him, and now the railway wants her to pony up $400,000 . The devastated mother even declined last year to sue the railroad, saying it was never about the money.‘We were happy with getting some safety measures in place. We never were seeking anything financial,’ she told the Star, adding ‘I was hoping to have some peace with the lights and the safety measures in place but that won’t be happening too soon.’Both the railway and Sharon Jobson are declining to comment publicly on the suit, with Sharon Jobson only telling CTV ‘I don’t want to be doing this at this time.I just want to have a peaceful time.'","This article discusses a somewhat shocking legal case that has emerged in North America.

"(CNN) -- Not long ago, I was in Pennsylvania coal country speaking with college students about the power of entrepreneurship and how everyone needs to take some risk these days or risk being left behind. During the Q&A, a hand shot up. ""I'm wondering how what you're saying applies to me,"" a young man said. ""I don't have a big idea. I don't have connections. And I don't live in Silicon Valley."" I said the first thing that came to mind. ""Don't worry. You don't need a hoodie to be an entrepreneur!"" Afterward, I was haunted by his question -- and disappointed by my glib response. When I first started helping entrepreneurs in the 1990s, the word ""entrepreneur"" was not popular. It was a rarefied word that applied only to founders of the fastest-growing (or fastest-failing) enterprises. And at the risk of pointing out the obvious, those leaders were mostly young, male and in tech. Today entrepreneurship doesn't just mean starting a tech company, as valuable as that may be. It means undertaking any bold venture -- from selling crafts out of your basement to improving your neighborhood to proposing a new initiative in your corporation. The techniques involved in sharpening your idea, facing down critics, recruiting boosters and handling setbacks apply in almost every realm of work. Entrepreneurship, defined as a nimble, creatively destructive, optimistic force, has become the go-to problem-solving technique of the 21st century. But that's also created a problem. The word ""entrepreneur,"" once underused, is now overused. We have ""social entrepreneurs,"" ""intrapreneurs,"" ""mompreneurs,"" ""kidpreneurs."" What we need is a new lexicon. In my book, ""Crazy Is a Compliment,"" I propose four categories, or species. 1. Gazelles . These are classic entrepreneurs -- those who start new businesses and aim to become hot phenomena. Think of Google, GoPro or Spanx. ""Gazelle"" was a term that economist David Birch came up with in 1994. It describes high-growth businesses whose sales double every four years. Though just 6% of companies fit this model, this miniscule group accounts for nearly all private sector job creation. Like the animal, gazelle entrepreneurs are fast-moving and high-jumping. 2. Skunks . The term ""intrapreneur,"" coined in the 1970s, refers to innovators within large corporations. Though the word remains clunky, the idea of encouraging employees to be more independent and creative has become an urgent cry. The ""topple rate"" of big companies, a metric that gauges how often they lose their leadership position, more than doubled between 1965 and 2008. Pretending your job is safe and your company is stable leaves you dangerously exposed. If you think risk-taking is risky, being risk-averse is often riskier. Even if your company continues to thrive, your ability to survive in it depends on your capacity and willingness to innovate. Job security these days depends on the same qualities that make good entrepreneurs -- agility, imagination, persistence and execution. As Michael Dell told me, ""There are the quick, and the dead."" Adapt from within or be forced to adapt from without. Become a skunk. I've adopted this term from Lockheed Corporation, which during World War II set up a secret division to build fighter jets. It was called Skunk Works. The message: entrepreneurs operating within large corporations go out of their way to stink up the joint. 3. Dolphins . For the past decade, there's been abundant chatter that the social sector must become more entrepreneurial. Nonprofits need to employ more business techniques. Philanthropy needs more metrics. Despite this, too many organizations continue to lag behind the age of disruption. What they need are more dolphins. Dolphins are contrarians in the nonprofit or public sector who are willing to buck convention and agitate for change. Why dolphins? Because they're smart, social and among the few altruistic animals. But they're not pushovers: harm a dolphin's pod and watch out! Today, even causes for which there are no compelling private-sector solutions are ripe for entrepreneurial shake-up. Dolphins are the ones making the waves. 4. Butterflies . The last group that needs to be more entrepreneurial are small-scale or lifestyle entrepreneurs -- plumbers, yoga instructors, bakers, craft makers. 40% of American adults have now spent part of their careers working on their own. As Jay-Z put it, ""I'm not a businessman; I'm a business, man."" I call this species butterflies, because butterflies are varied (there are at least 17,500 types) and driven by freedom and individualism. At first glance, this group would hardly seem candidates for the skillset of ground-breaking change-makers. Do you really need to be disruptive when you're selling homemade cheese at the farmer's market? The answer: You do, because your competitor probably has an in at Whole Foods, accepts credit-card payments with a Square reader and just launched a vibrant web business. Etsy, the online arts and crafts hub, now has over a million ""makers"" selling goods directly to consumers. Even butterflies need to spread their wings wider. Today, nearly two decades after I first started mentoring entrepreneurs, innovators of all types are popping up everywhere. They aren't waiting for changes to happen to them, they're making changes happen every day. Whatever your passion, pick one of these species and start writing your story -- or risk being an ostrich, with your head stuck in the sand.","This article discusses the way entrepreneurship has evolved over time, and ventures into a profound conversation on the definition and understanding of the term 'entrepreneur'.

"(CNN) -- In Madrid, all the talk is about ""La Decima"". In London, all the talk was about the ""Special One"". Tonight, after a performance which helped to write another chapter in one of the season's most romantic fairy tales, Atletico Madrid allowed itself to dream of its own special one -- La Primera -- the first. Atletico, for so long a club living in the shadow of city rival Real, has the opportunity to make history not just at home but also on the European stage. A convincing 3-1 win over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge secured a place in the Champions League final and allowed the dream of a league and European double to prosper. This Atletico team has guts, resilience and an indefatigable spirit -- but what it also has, in abundance, is quality. Trailing to Fernando Torres' strike, Atletico offered a brutal riposte with Adrian Lopez leveling before Diego Costa and Arda Turan applied the finishing touches. Four points clear at the top of La Liga with three games remaining and a clash with Real to decide the destiny of the Champions League trophy to come in Lisbon on May 24, this is turning out to be some season for Atletico. ""It's a dream,"" Atletico midfielder Tiago told Sky Sports. ""We have a great spirit, we are a great team, we all work together, now we are in the final in Lisbon, the dreams can be true. ""It is not easy to play here, we know that. But we knew Chelsea had to play more. ""We know we are very good away from home. After our goal Chelsea went down a bit, but we were confident and now we are there. ""We know Real Madrid is a fantastic team with great players. They can win the game in any action but we are there. Last year we won the Cup in their stadium so we are confident."" Not since 1996 has Los Rojiblancos won the domestic title but managed by Diego Simeone, who was part of that team 18 years ago, it now stands on the brink of history. Simeone, who presides over a budget nearly five times smaller than Real, has worked wonders but perhaps even would not have expected his players to record such an impressive victory. To score three goals away from home in European competition is a marked achievement, but to do so against Chelsea, a team whose defense has been so miserly in the competition, is staggering. Chelsea, derided for its defensive tactics and considered an ""enemy of football"" by some because of its negative approach, has already answered its critics on numerous occasions this season. A fine victory at Liverpool on Sunday proved once again that Mourinho's tactics, however unpalatable, gain results. But on this occasion, the solidity and cohesion which had caused such frustration in Madrid last week, was missing. The dour goalless draw in the opening leg led to plenty of accusations that Chelsea had not attempted to win the game but simply stifle Atletico. There is no doubt that Mourinho has been hurt by the criticism and hit back at his detractors by claiming that ""at this moment, football is full of philosophers."" While everybody appears to have an opinion on Chelsea's defensive approach, Mourinho sticks to the belief which has made him a serial winner -- winning at all costs. The prospect of facing his former employer, Real Madrid, in the final added another subplot to an already intriguing tie. Eden Hazard, back from injury, was restored to the side, and Chelsea, often so adroit at scraping through tight contests, appeared confident. Yet it was the visitors who began the brighter of the two. Atletico, on the brink of the domestic title and chasing a place in the final for the first time in 40 years, played with a sense of purpose and came within inches of taking an early lead. Koke, influential throughout, aimed what looked like a cross towards goal only for the ball to sail over Chelsea goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer and smash against the crossbar. Chelsea responded with David Luiz's overhead kick sailing just wide of the far post as the home side stepped up the pressure. And with 11 minutes of the first half remaining, the home side finally made the breakthrough. Willian escaped his marker on the right before finding Cesar Azpilicueta, who in turn found Torres to fire home from inside the penalty area. Torres, who began his career at Atletico and scored 84 goals in 214 games for the club before moving to Liverpool in 2007, refused to celebrate but that gesture did not detract from the significance of the strike. Buoyed by the goal, Chelsea began to take control and with its resilient defense holding Atletico comfortably, the visitors appeared rattled. But with just a minute of the opening period remaining, the game was turned on its head. Tiago, once of Chelsea, picked out Juanfran at the far post and when he crossed the ball into the penalty area, Lopez was on hand to steer the ball home. Mourinho's defense, such an integral part of his side's success, appeared brittle for the first time in the competition and it never really recovered. Within minutes of the restart, Schwarzer was forced to produce a fine save to deny Turan after the Atletico midfielder had found space inside the penalty area. While Schwarzer performed heroics at one end, Thibaut Courtois, on loan from Chelsea, did similar at the other. John Terry's powerful header looked certain to find the net but Courtois produced an astonishing stop to deny the Chelsea captain. That save appeared to change the momentum of the contest and slowly but surely, Atletico began to turn the screw . With an hour of the game gone, Atletico finally struck and grabbed the initiative. Diego Costa, a man constantly linked with a move to Chelsea, was fouled inside the penalty area by Samuel Eto'o. The Spain striker, who endured a nervous wait to take the spot kick after the ball failed to settle on the spot, fired home emphatically to put his side within touching distance of glory. An eerie silence engulfed Stamford Bridge and but for a few thousand Spaniards clad in red and white, a sense of hopelessness began to emanate. Chelsea, to its credit, refused to give up the fight and came perilously close to equalizing within five minutes. Willian's exquisite free kick caused panic in the Atletico defense and Luiz sent a header crashing against the post when the ball seemed destined for the net. Chelsea, by now beginning to look ragged and forlorn, strained every sinew in an attempt to gain some sort of foothold to launch a comeback. But as the home side pushed forward, Atletico countered and in doing so, swiftly put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach. Once again, a wonderful switch of play caught Chelsea sleeping and after sending a powerful header against the crossbar from Juanfran's cross, Arda tucked away the rebound from his own effort. That strike sent Simeone down the touchline dancing a jig of delight a la Mourinho all those years ago. It is a jig he will hope to dance again in Lisbon with the whole world watching.","The article primarily discusses intricate nuances of a highly anticipated football match, simultaneously examining the strategic aspect of the game and the individual brilliance that surfaced during its progressing phases.

Bush defended his administration's handling of the war in Afghanistan on Sunday, telling CNN that some NATO allies who contributed troops to the conflict ""turned out not to be willing to fight."" In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Bush strongly refuted criticism that his administration took its ""eye off the ball"" in Afghanistan when he ordered troops to invade Iraq. He said he ordered American forces to overthrow Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein with the assumption that allied forces would help make up the difference in Afghanistan. ""What happened in Afghanistan was that our NATO allies, some of them, turned out not to be willing to fight,"" Bush said. ""Therefore, our assumption that we had ample troops -- U.S. and NATO troops -- turned out to be a not-true assumption. So we adjusted."" The former president didn't name any countries specifically from NATO, which includes 28 nations in Europe and North America. Some 785 military personnel from NATO countries besides the United States have been killed in Afghanistan since hostilities began in October 2001, with the United Kingdom, Canada and France having the most fatalities. The comments by the 43rd U.S. president, along with those of his brother and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, aired during a CNN special, ""Bush: Two Years Later."" The former president addressed a host of matters in the interview, which came days after the release of his 481-page memoir, ""Decision Points,"" and two days ahead of the groundbreaking for his presidential library and museum on Southern Methodist University's campus in Dallas, Texas. Bush said he ""felt terrible"" that weapons of mass destruction were never found in Iraq, despite the administration's persistent and insistent case that Saddam Hussein had them before the invasion. But while he took responsibility for the big push on and subsequent lack of WMDs, the former president said he still thought the Iraq war was justified. ""If (Saddam Hussein) was in power today, the world would be a lot worse off,"" he said. ""I believe that a free Iraq will be transformative in the Middle East."" Bush said he had no regrets, too, about his decision near the end of his second term to push the 2008 federal bailout that loaned hundreds of billions of dollars to companies including AIG, Citigroup, Bank of America and General Motors. President Barack Obama later successfully pressed to use billions more in federal funds to buttress the U.S. economy, as it struggled through what's been called ""The Great Recession"" marked by high unemployment and rounds of foreclosures in a percolating real estate crisis. ""I set aside my free market principles and made a very difficult decision,"" Bush said. ""I believe that those decisions ... did prevent the economy from heading into a depression."" Bush said he was dismayed when his administration's efforts to efforts to change the Social Security system -- an effort to control its costs -- failed to bear fruit. In late 2004 and early 2005, his administration laid out proposals to overhaul Social Security, in part by creating individual investment accounts that would act more like a traditional 401k and replace the current collective Social Security pool. But the plan floundered under pressure from Democrats and special interest groups such as the AARP, and Congress never even saw any formal legislation, much less voted on it. ""Not reforming Social Security was a huge disappointment,"" Bush said. Jeb Bush joined his brother for part of the CNN interview, saying he never publicly disagreed with George W. Bush when he was president and is ""not going to start now."" Alluding to the hyperpartisanship in Washington, the former Florida governor said there's still room for civility in politics. ""I don't think you can be against everything, just because someone has a D (for Democrat) by their name and you have an R (for Republican) by your name,"" Jeb Bush said. George W. Bush said that he was mindful not to get involved in ""name calling"" as president, adding that he wasn't bothered when he was targeted. Bush said, too, that he didn't support Republicans challenging Democrats' patriotism just because they disagreed with them. ""I don't remember doing that personally, and that was uncalled for if that was the case,"" he said. ""Patriotic people disagreed with my decisions."" One Democrat he has no qualms with is his Oval Office predecessor, Bill Clinton. Bush said he ""genuinely liked"" Clinton, whom he called one of his ""buddies,"" in part because he's been so ""gracious"" to his father, George H.W. Bush. iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush . The Bush brothers both said Republicans' setbacks in recent election among Latinos -- which voted Democrat by a 2-to-1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party, with George W. Bush calling the situation ""un problemo."" ""Part of it relates to tone,"" said Jeb Bush, saying some Latinos turned away from the Republican party when some of its members spoke strongly on illegal immigration. ""If they don't feel welcome, they're not going to listen to the message."" Jeb Bush reiterated that he would not run for president -- like his brother and father -- in 2012. The former governor also said he did not want to head the national Republican party because he wanted to achieve ""some financial independence"" for himself and his family. The current GOP party chief, Michael Steele, has faced persistent criticism from Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, and others in recent months, even though Republicans scored big wins in the recent mid-term elections. As to speculation about Steele's future as the party's head, Jeb Bush opted not to wade into the party leadership debate, saying he was ""Switzerland in relation to national Republican politics."" ""If I'm trying to achieve financial security for my family and I'm not running for office,"" Jeb Bush said. ""I certainly wouldn't run for RNC chairman."" Jeb Bush said that he could see either or both of his sons, Jeb and George, following their father, their uncle, their grandfather and their great-grandfather (former Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut) by running for political office. But George W. Bush said he didn't see his daughters, twins Jenna and Barbara, who turn 29 this month, going into politics. ""They will be involved in helping improve people's lives,"" Bush said. ""But I doubt they'll ever run for public office."" As to his own future, and legacy, Bush said he was content to let his memoir and his decisions speak for themselves. ""I'm not trying to shape my legacy,"" he said. ""I'm trying to provide data points for future historians.""","The article under discussion entails the substance of an interview conducted with former U.S. President George W. Bush, in which he articulates his perspective on multiple aspects of his presidential tenure. It further delves into the realm of reflections on international relations, domestic policies, and critical decisions taken during his administration.

The moment of truth: Ryan Swinburn could not collect his GCSE results until he paid his lunch bill . A teenager who almost died during a GCSE exam when he suffered a heart attack at his desk was banned from collecting his results - because he had an outstanding £5.60 lunch bill. Teachers told schoolboy Ryan Swinburn he could not have his exam grades until he paid for the pizza and baguette he had eaten months earlier. The 16-year-old had been unable to settle the canteen bill after he was rushed into hospital with multiple organ failure, having recently been diagnosed with cardiolipin syndrome. He was discharged from hospital in time to sit his GCSEs but almost died in May when he suffered a cardiac arrest during a maths exam. But he was shocked when he went to school to collect his results last month and was told they were being withheld because of the outstanding lunch debt. Ryan, from Rugby, Warwickshire, said: 'It was all a bit ludicrous really. 'I’ve had a tough time and because I wasn’t at school I wasn’t able to pay the bill. 'One of my teachers slyly told me I had got a C when I got there on the day so it really got me excited to see whether I had done the same in any other subjects. 'But when my head of year told me I couldn’t have them until I had settled a mere £5.60 - I was shocked. 'I hadn’t taken any money with me because I hadn’t really been thinking about the outstanding bill for a pizza, baguette and a drink - I was more concerned about my health.

He was forced to spend three months in hospital undergoing dialysis and taking a daily cocktail of powerful steroids to control his condition. Incredibly, the dedicated teenager battled to become well enough to sit his GCSEs in May but was rushed back to hospital after collapsing just minutes after starting the first exam. The school agreed to award Ryan, who wants to study psychology and sociology at A-Level, his GCSEs based on his mock exam results and predicted grades. But when he went to school on August 31 to collect his results he was turned away at the door until he paid the canteen bill. He walked home and returned with his fuming mother Deborah Harris, 44, who stormed back to the school to demand an explanation. She said: 'Settling a £5 bill was the last thing on his mind - he has been seriously ill in hospital. 'He struggled to get to the school on that day but he was determined to collect his results with his friends. 'But he was humiliated in front of all his mates and this is the last thing he needed. Family: Ryan supported by his brothers Ross Took , 21 (left), and Toby Swinburn, 11 (right) 'I was also worried about his blood pressure because that can be high because of his illness. 'I thought they should at least show the lad a bit of compassion after what he has been through. 'I think it is disgusting how they treated him - it wasn’t even some random receptionist - it was his head of year who knew fully well what he had been through. 'I was told it was school policy. 'I explained how ill Ryan had been and felt she showed no compassion for my child. 'The whole situation was ludicrous - it was totally ridiculous. 'He really wants to go to college now, he really is a determined little thing and he’s had a rough ride.'

"Mr Justice Tugendhat told her 'unwelcome publicity' received after affair with Mr Huhne was 'situation entirely of her own making' MP Chris Huhne's partner Carina Trimingham has lost her privacy and harassment claim against Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail. Her affair with the former secretary of state for energy and climate change became public in June 2010, with Mr Huhne leaving his wife of 26 years. The 44-year-old PR adviser sued for compensation and an injunction over 65 'highly unpleasant and hurtful' articles which have appeared since then. She claimed she was subject to 'crude and demeaning stereotypes' about her being bisexual. Dismissed: Carina Trimingham gives a statement today outside the High Court after today's hearing . But despite Ms Trimingham's lawyers claiming the stories constituted a 'cataclysmic interference' with her private life, a High Court judge today rejected her claim on the grounds that her involvement with the former energy secretary was 'a situation of her own making'. The High Court judge also said he had not found Ms Trimingham to be a good or reliable witness in a number of respects. Associated Newspapers described the ruling by Mr Justice Tugendhat as 'an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech'. Associated Newspapers had contested Ms Trimingham's case on the basis that there was an important public interest. Ms Trimingham's counsel, Matthew Ryder QC, said the Daily Mail had a right to freedom of expression but not to abuse her repeatedly under the guise of exercising that freedom. Ms Trimingham was in court today but showed no emotion as her claim was dismissed by the judge. Relationship: Chris Huhne and Carine Trimingham, pictured last September, had an affair which became public in June 2010 . He said: 'Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited. 'This is mainly by reason of her involvement with Mr Huhne, both professionally, as his press agent, and personally as his secret mistress, in circumstances where he campaigned with a leaflet to the electorate of Eastleigh about how much he valued his family. 'But it is also by reason of what she herself has disclosed in the past. 'Further, she was, as the defendant knew, a journalist who had herself disclosed information about other people for publication in the newspapers and so was a person who ought not reasonably to be expected to be distressed when such information was published about herself.' 'Ms Trimingham has shown little sign of recognising how what she herself has done has given rise to the publicity she finds so unwelcome.'The difficult situation she found herself in was of her own making. Ms Trimingham, speaking today on the steps of the High Court, was not found to be a good or reliable witness during her claim by Mr Justice Tugendhat . 'One reason why it is objectionable for a sexual relationship to arise between people who are already in a professional or work relationship is that there is then a greatly increased risk of conflicts arising between professional duty and personal interest.' It was this crossing of boundaries which led an editorial executive on the newspaper to consider that Ms Trimingham's role in the story of Mr Huhne was so significant, he added. 'Professionally, it was her job to ensure that Mr Huhne received the best possible publicity, but it was the sexual affair on which she embarked, and which she continued to conduct, with Mr Huhne that gave rise to the scandal. He added that although Associated referred to Ms Trimingham's sexuality in 65 articles over 15 months, it only did so when writing about matters of public interest - mainly developments in Mr Huhne's personal life which were relevant to his public life - and when Ms Trimingham, her conduct and other information about her were within the range of what an editor could in good faith regard as relevant to the story. 'The distress that she has undoubtedly suffered since June 19, 2010 is the result of the publication by the defendant of the defamatory and true information concerning her, about which she has not made a claim in defamation, and the actions of journalists and publishers for whom the defendant is not responsible. 'To the extent that the words complained of include insults and other offensive matter, insulting and offensive speech is protected by the right of freedom of expression. 'In this case what Ms Trimingham complains of is not so unreasonable that it is necessary or proportionate to sanction or prohibit such publications in order to protect the rights of Ms Trimingham. 'So the defendant has not harassed her within the meaning of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. It is not the case that a reasonable person in the position of the defendant ought to have known that these articles, separately, or cumulatively, amount to harassment of Ms Trimingham.' He added that Ms Trimingham had no reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to various items of information, including cropped versions of photos taken at her civil partnership ceremony, which revealed no more information about her than the public already knew. Ms Trimingham was not the purely private figure she claims to be. Her reasonable expectation of privacy has become limited.' Outside court, Ms Trimingham said she intended to appeal. Ms Trimingham, who is insured, was ordered to pay £250,000 towards Associated’s costs. A spokesman for Associated Newspapers said: 'This was an important example of the press exercising its right to free speech in relation to matters of significant public interest. A High Court judge told Ms Trimingham, pictured left today and right at the Lib Dem Annual Conference last September, that she was in a situation 'of her own making' 'We are pleased that the Court agreed with us and has today dismissed all of Miss Trimingham’s complaints. 'The references to Miss Trimingham’s sexuality in our coverage were never pejorative, private or in any way homophobic. 'Miss Trimingham chose to level some very serious charges against our journalists in this case. This judgement vindicates both our journalists and their journalism. Media law specialist Mark Stephens said Mr Justice Tugendhat, in his judgment, had drawn a distinction between private and public figures by importing the American notion of a public figure. 'It is redolent of the approach taken to Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,' he said. 'Mr Clinton, as president, had a restricted zone of privacy, and Ms Lewinsky's zone of privacy was reduced by virtue of her relationship with him. 'It appears that that ratio was very similar in this case.'

"Washington (CNN) -- Current and past first ladies Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Reagan will attend a memorial service Tuesday in California for former first lady Betty Ford. The White House announced that Obama would travel to Palm Desert, California, for the Tuesday service, which will be followed by a private funeral Thursday in Michigan. Clinton, the current secretary of state, will be accompanied Tuesday by her husband, former President Bill Clinton, an aide told CNN. Reagan also will attend the California service at St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, a Reagan Foundation official said. Former President George W. Bush also will attend the service but without his wife, former first lady Laura Bush, who had previous travel commitments, according to a spokesman. Bush's mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, will attend the Michigan funeral, the spokesman said. Following the Tuesday service, Ford's remains will lie in repose at the church until midnight, then be flown on Wednesday to Michigan to the Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, according to a website on the memorial plans. Ford's remains will then lie in repose there beginning at 7 p.m. local time, said a statement posted on the website. On Thursday, Ford's private funeral will be held at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, the statement on the website said. Ford, who died Friday at age 93, raised awareness of issues involving women's rights, cancer, alcoholism and substance abuse during and after her stint as first lady. Her late husband, former President Gerald Ford, died in 2006. The alcohol and substance abuse treatment center in Rancho Mirage, California, that bears her name has become one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the country. In remarks to reporters Monday, Clinton said she was ""grateful for having known"" Ford. ""Her commitment to speaking out on issues that, before she took them on, were just not discussed made a huge difference in the lives of Americans,"" Clinton said.

"By . Alice Smellie . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 31 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 2 September 2013 . Au naturelle: Victoria Beckham is thought to have chosen teardrop-shaped implants for her second operation . Evolutionary theorists call them ‘sexual ornaments’. According to  academics, the human female bosom is unique among primates. While ape species have large breasts only during lactation, the same isn’t true for us. And as they remain after menopause, they are not an indicator of fertility. So, look away now feminists... the way they look mainly serves to attract a mate. Thus, women have always drawn attention to their busts with padding, corsetry, or simply by going topless. Today, the boob job is the most . commonly performed cosmetic surgery, with more than 10,000 British women . having one last year. And as The Mail on Sunday reported last week, British breast implant manufacturer Nagor claim one in ten patients now opts for a ‘super boob job,’ increasing their bust by four or more cup sizes in a single operation. However, many women still want a more discreet option dubbed the ‘has she or hasn’t she’ boob job. Miles . Berry, a plastic surgeon and co-author of the Good Boob Bible, says: . ‘Victoria Beckham epitomises the new trend. 'She has never admitted to . surgery, but pictures show  her breasts are incredibly supple and full – . better than in her youth.’ Despite . technological and surgical advances, there are still pitfalls when . trying to choose the perfect pair. Here, experts advise how to get it . just right. IGNORE CUP SIZE . Size . is dictated by the volume of the implant and measured in cubic . centimetres (a 151cc to 250cc implant will give around a one to two-cup . size increase). If you are looking for a natural-looking boob job, . consultant plastic surgeon Patrick Mallucci  recommends forgetting about . cup size altogether. ‘Don’t . come in saying, “I am a B and I’d like to be a DD”. Cup size is highly . subjective. I might see 20 women measuring 34C, all with completely . different breasts,’ he explains. Ultimately you want a breast which is . in proportion and the right implant that will achieve that. THE PERFECT SHAPE . In . 2011, Mallucci analysed the mathematical factors of attractive breasts, . using 100 Page 3 models, all of whom had real breasts, as research . material. The resulting . formula revealed a template for both surgeons and women considering . surgery: 45 per cent of breast volume is above the nipple; the nipple . points upwards at an average angle of 20 degrees; the upper half is . either straight or concave, and the lower half a neat, full curve. Back in the days: There was no mistaking that Victoria Beckham had a boob job eight years ago, but later had her 'chest oranges', right, swapped for a more natural looking implant . Mallucci says: ‘The dimensions are a template, whether you are simply enlarging or lifting as well.’ That said, the desire is normally to have bigger breasts. If you want a natural-looking boob job which is aesthetically ideal, there are limitations depending on your frame and anatomy. ‘The surgeon ought to measure the width of your breast to select the implant size,’ he says. Too big a width means the implant shows on top of the rib cage. ‘As long as you stick to this rule you are close to achieving the perfect shape. Too large will never look natural.’ PROJECT YOURSELF . ‘Projection, or pertness, of the breasts is down to the shape of the implant itself,’ says consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah. ‘There are different silhouettes – low, medium, high or extra-high.’ ‘The patient’s physiology must be taken into account. A 20-year-old with a flat chest couldn’t have an extra high projection as the skin would be too stretched,’ Fatah adds. ‘Under-filling is equally disastrous as it will make the skin sag around the implant,’ says Mallucci. ‘Post-pregnancy, you may have a deflated breast. The more skin laxity, the more projection is necessary.’ Another important consideration is breast tissue and skin quality. ‘Older or post-pregnancy skin  may be very thin,’ says Mallucci. ‘You don’t want the implant to  show underneath.’ ROUNDING UP . A round shape accounts for 82 per cent of implants in Britain. The other option is a teardrop-shaped implant. Fazel Fatah explains: ‘The round implant looks fuller at the top, while the teardrop slopes downwards like a natural breast. ‘Not many people have the teardrop because the surgical technique has to be very precise to avoid the implant rotating within the breast. It takes longer in theatre and the implant itself costs more, so the option is more expensive.’ There can be a £1,000 difference. Popular op: More than 10,000 British women had plastic surgery on their chest last year . TRY BEFORE YOU BUY . Some surgeons offer 3D imaging, but usually surgeons suggest ‘trying out’ new breasts by wearing a larger bra filled with an implant. ‘British women want fullness at the top, or the Wonder-Bra effect,’ says Mallucci. ‘But if the breasts stay that shape when naked, they’ll look a bit weird. This means limiting volume in the upper bust. You can still wear an enhancing bra afterwards.’ SAFETY FIRST . ‘Women should be as informed as possible about exactly what goes into their bodies,’ says consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Michael Cadier. The most important factor is not the type of implant, but the safety record. European legislation isn’t particularly stringent, but the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved five brands of implant. ‘Should your surgeon not suggest one with FDA approval then there ought to be good safety data demonstrated in the form of long-term clinical follow-ups of a minimum of five years, looking at the integrity of the implant and effects on the body,’ says Berry. A BOOB JOB IS FOR LIFE . ‘The body forms scar tissue around the implant. This fibrous bag usually starts to contract after a decade, and the breast may look unnatural. If it becomes unevenly shaped it may have ruptured,’ says Berry. However, as long as you have a decent implant there are no serious concerns should this happen. ‘Women often only find out about rupture when they go for a mammogram at 50,’ he adds. Once you know they’re broken, they ought to be removed. Many women need reductions too. ‘This is why a size eight woman wanting to have massive breasts is going to be in trouble,’ says Fatah. ‘The breast tissue will be very thin and when they are replaced she may be left with sagging breasts.’","This article dives into the fascinating world of cosmetic surgery, more specifically, breast augmentation.

"(CNN) -- Take one part Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" two parts Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" and an even larger measure of guesswork and North Korea's latest political drama could seem like a Cold War thriller. For North Korea watchers, the all too real political theater playing out in Pyongyang may offer another tantalizing glimpse behind the opaque curtain of the North Korean regime, but raises more questions than answers. Depending on how you read the signs, the execution of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's uncle and formerly trusted regent, Jang Song Thaek, either shows a young leader further cementing his control, or the first death throes of a regime teetering on collapse. In the absence of any independently verifiable information, and in a regime where paranoid rhetoric is the normal register of almost all diplomatic language, any conjecture is likely to be as accurate as it is to be wide of the mark. North Korea: Leader's 'traitor' uncle executed . For Jasper Kim, the founder of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, North Korea remains for analysts a ""Rubik's Cube that no one can solve."" He said North Korea is a master at carefully choreographing the way it releases news events to cloak its real intentions. Nevertheless, he said a careful reading between the lines of North Korean new agency KCNA sometimes reveals glimpses of the state of the regime. He said that far from asserting the leadership of Kim, recent events suggest that his position has been seriously eroded by the execution of his uncle. ""My guess is that these events happened some time ago and they are only now being released,"" Kim told CNN. ""The fact is that we don't know what's going on in North Korea but what we are seeing coming through on KCNA is very concerning. ""When you look at the language used in these KCNA reports it is particularly hawkish and it's much more reflective of the military than it is of Kim Jong Un. ""Basically we are seeing the hardline faction reassert itself. For Kim Jong Un, Jang Song Thaek was the bridge between him and his father, and now he will have very little protection."" He said that North Korea, famous for tightly controlling the drip feed of real information coming out of the country, was now sending out violently mixed messages. ""The recent release of the prisoner (Merrill Newman) and this execution couldn't be more at odds; what this indicates is that it's a chaotic situation in there,"" he added. ""What this points to in terms of regime change is that it's a question of 'when' rather than 'if.' ""What history tells us is that when it does happen it will be unexpected and extreme and everyone must be prepared for the worst case scenario."" For Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul, however, the purge of Jang shows a young leader consolidating his grip on power. ""Some of the reasons are quite obvious and very transparent and many predicted that this was going to happen. What is really surprising is how it happened. Pretty much everybody expected that in the near future a state head would be removed from power,"" Lankov told CNN. ""But people did not expect that it would happen in such a dramatic and theatrical manner."" He said that Jang's removal and execution displayed the deadly manner of generational political change in North Korea. ""Kim Jong Un became the leader of the country after only one year of being a kind of anointed successor. He has had no time to create his own team, so he's had no choice but to rely on the team from his father and this team consists of people who are in their 60s and 70s and sometimes even older. He said that this politburo consisted of men who could be Kim's father or even grandfather. ""Imagine how difficult it is to run a country -- especially one with a strong Confucian tradition -- when all your senior advisers are older than you. And these are people who can have very different ideas of goals and strategies. ""It was clear from the first days of his rule that he would remove most of the people around him. Jang was particularly vulnerable exactly because he was initially appointed by late Kim Jong Il to be a regent -- the chief adviser to the young ruler. ""But being a regent is a dangerous job. The king gets older and he feels more and more irritation and to hold more of a grudge against these noisy, strange, grumpy old men. ""For a regent, it's very good to know when to retire but not everyone is smart enough."" Opinion: How Kim purged his uncle .","The article under discussion scrutinizes the profoundly enigmatic political circumstances that seem to be unfolding in North Korea. The analytic gaze is focused principally on the peculiar unfoldings within the country's leadership, with an unusually strong spotlight being cast upon key figureheads namely Kim Jong Un and Jang Song Thaek. A multitude of assertions and particularities springing from varied sources serve to both amplify and further obscure the true nature of the situation. This discourse finally emphasizes the paramount uncertainty encapsulating these events and their potential implications.","Analysts from diverse backgrounds, including the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group, attempt to decode North Korea's cryptic politics, intensively examining the power dynamics between Kim Jong Un and the executed Jang Song Thaek. Various sources perpetuate an intriguing, yet enigmatic narrative, embroidering the mystery surrounding North Korea's true position. North Korean news agency, KCNA's reports provide fleeting glimpses into the state of the regime, amidst the country's taut string of information control. Despite meticulous analysis, the discourse imbues an overpowering sense of uncertainty about potential implications and forthcoming outcomes.","Analysts, including Jasper Kim of the Asia-Pacific Global Research Group and Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, scrutinize North Korea's byzantine politics, particularly the dynamics between Kim Jong Un and his executed uncle, Jang Song Thaek. The KCNA's reports offer occasional insights into the regime's status, despite controlled information flow, dramatically signaled by unexpected events like Merrill Newman's release and Jang's execution. Amidst this cryptic narrative, a palpable uncertainty prevails about the regime's stability and future direction.","North Korea's intricate politics are analyzed by Jasper Kim of Asia-Pacific Global Research Group and Andrei Lankov from Seoul's Kookmin University, highlighting the relationship between Kim Jong Un and his executed uncle, Jang Song Thaek.

"They look innocent enough but these four, every-day items wreak havoc on the average couple’s sex life. Banish them from your bedroom and you’re instantly in store for a year of better, more frequent sex! YOUR TV . Couples who have a TV in their bedroom have sex half as often as those who don’t: that’s a fact, supported by reputable research. Why? It stops you both talking, it robs you of sleep (the better rested we are, the healthier and higher our libido) and it keeps you grounded in reality. By keeping your laptop or iPad in your bedroom you destroy intimacy and distract from sex . God help us all, but reality shows like The Kardashian's suck some people into the trap of thinking what we watch on telly is actually real. It’s not. Sex on telly is peppered with couples having more simultaneous orgasms than cups of tea. In real life, they’re actually pretty rare. Tracey says that in order to have the best sex possible it is wise to choose a firmer bed . All of this leads to unrealistic expectations and constant disappointment with our sex lives. YOUR IPADS AND PHONES . Ditching the telly won’t do a thing if you replace it with another device to distract you from sex and each other. Slip into bed and pull out your ipad or phone and the effect on your relationship is even worse! These gadgets are portable, so capable of destroying intimacy anywhere. Foreplay should begin way before you take your clothes off and if your partner’s spent all night on their phone, giving other people attention, why would you want to give them yours? One recent study found it’s especially harmful if one person uses technology more than the other - the second person feels ignored and insecure. Neither are emotions likely to trigger a bit of rumpy-pumpy. A SOFT, LUMPY BED . The best beds for good sex are firm with no hard edges. You need a firm foundation to master creative sex positions and to be able to sit or lean on the edges without hitting anything hard. Clean, fresh linen is inviting; scratchy, balled-up sheets, not so much (though there is something undeniably sexy about a crumpled bed that you both have just had sex in!). A few firm pillows are perfect for lifting and supporting body bits to make sex super comfy and those more adventurous positions more ‘doable’. SLOPPY SLEEPWEAR . Well-worn, snuggly track pants and wooly socks might make us feel cosy when it’s cold outside, but they do little to get your partner hot and bothered. I’m not suggesting tottering to bed in high heels and sexy stay-up stockings on Monday nights but aiming for a happy medium by choosing something that’s at least a little flattering isn’t too much to ask, surely? Check out traceycox.com for more advice, Tracey's books and product range.","This article discusses the influence of common household items on a couple’s sexual intimacy.

"(CNN) -- Mexico's international image may be taking hits because of the violence produced by drug cartels, but it hasn't hurt its tourism industry, officials say. International tourism to Mexico has increased 2.1% in the first five months of 2011 compared to 2010, and it remains the top destination for Americans traveling abroad. Statistics from the U.S. Department of Commerce show that fewer Americans are traveling abroad, but a bigger percentage of those who do are going to Mexico. Mexico also reported double-digit increases in the percentage of visitors from Russia, Brazil and China, among others. ""The data doesn't lie,"" Mexico's deputy secretary for tourism, Ricardo Anaya, told CNN. ""Tourists keep choosing Mexico."" The unrelenting battles between rival drug cartels and police and cartels have provided nearly unlimited fodder for those who write off Mexico as a dangerous destination. The truth, Anaya said, is that the violence is limited to certain geographic areas that can be avoided by tourists. The border area, for example, where much violence has been recorded, is 1,200 miles from the resort town of Cancun -- that's like avoiding travel to Houston because of problems in New York, he said. According to surveys by Mexican tourism authorities, 98% of those who do visit Mexico say they will come back, and 99% recommend it to others. Opinion: Why you should go to Mexico . Much of the growth has been fueled by new programs to incentivize tourists from emerging economies, such as the so-called BRIC countries -- Brazil, Russia, India and China. For starters, Mexico began allowing holders of U.S. visas to enter Mexico, opening up the possibility of tourists to the United States extending their trips south of the border. Also, Brazilians, Russians and Ukrainian visitors can gain travel permission to Mexico on the Internet, with no need for a visa. Finally, for travelers from other countries, visas to Mexico in many cases can be obtained through a travel agent, erasing the need for trips to embassies. In 2011 to date, Mexico has seen a 40.9% increase in Brazilian tourists, a 58.1% increase from Russia and 32.8% increase from China, according to Mexico's tourism ministry. For U.S. travelers specifically, the Commerce Department's most recent data -- for 2009 -- shows that 31.7% of all U.S. international tourists go to Mexico. From 2002 to 2009, while U.S. tourism to Canada fell by more than 27%, tourism to Mexico from the U.S. increased by 5.1%. This happened even though the overall number of Americans traveling abroad decreased, from a peak of 64 million in 2007 to 61.4 million in 2009. When Kendra Young, a high school teacher in Texas, told her friends that she and her husband's family were going to Cozumel for a yearly retreat, she was met with skepticism. Are you worried, they would ask? Are you still going? ""I think people see all of Mexico as one entity,"" she told CNN. It was the third straight year that she traveled to the same resort, and security was not a concern for her. Young is pregnant, and she was more worried about food-borne or water-borne illness. She was aware of several State Department travel warnings to Mexico's cartel hot spots, but she also knew that the area she was traveling to was not affected. Her group planned to stay on the resort, where they felt safest, but on the advice of resort staff they trusted from the previous trips, they ventured into the city without worries. ""Unfortunately, there are the headline-grabbing things -- the drugs, the violence -- but I don't think that's indicative of what's happening in the entire country,"" Young said. Anaya pointed out that Americans are not unaware of the violence -- 80% of Americans who travel to Mexico go to six places, none of which have had travel alerts. The destinations are Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Cancun, Puerto Vallarta/Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico City and Los Cabos, he said. Some beach destinations, like Acapulco, have been the scene of some of the drug cartel bloodshed, but still managed to increase its tourism 3% in the first five months of 2011 compared to last year, thanks to national, rather than international, tourism. But some pitfalls of tourism in Mexico persist. Tucson, Arizona, resident Denise Hermosillo and a couple of friends made the six-hour trek last week from her home to Bahia de Kino in the state of Sonora, Mexico. This area is not under a travel warning, but is not among the top destinations for American tourists. ""I was scared out of my mind to go there,"" Hermosillo said. Friends of hers who are in the military are not allowed to cross the border and urged her not to do the same. But she wanted to go to the beach to write for a book she is working on, and Bahia de Kino is the closest one. On the first day of her vacation, her group was pulled over by a police officer, who promptly asked for $100 in exchange to letting them go. In the moment she was frightened, all those stories about bloody ends in Mexico rushing to her mind. But she negotiated the bribe down to $20 and her group was allowed to continue on their journey. ""It was pretty pathetic, I thought. What are you going to do with 20 bucks?"" she said. Still, she was unable to relax during her vacation. Would she go back? She doesn't know. Would she recommend Mexico to a friend? Maybe, but only if you are traveling with someone who could act as a guide.","In an expansive discourse, this particular article broaches the intriguing subject of Mexico's enduring appeal as a tourism hotspot, notwithstanding the looming cloud of drug-related violence. It presents a compelling analysis of how, despite concerns about its international image, Mexico's allure remains seemingly unaffected. Key governmental officials are quoted, underscoring the robustness of the travel sector. Additionally, the narrative embarks on an interesting exploration of strategies implemented to lure visitors from emerging markets and the impact of these on Mexico's tourist inflow.","Despite ongoing cartels' violence, Mexico retains its appeal as a preferred destination, thanks to targeted initiatives attracting tourists from emerging markets, including BRIC countries. Figures from Mexico's Deputy Secretary for Tourism, Ricardo Anaya, and the U.S. Department of Commerce affirm the stability of the tourism sector. Notwithstanding concerns of Mexico's international image, the country witnessed a 2.1% growth in international visits in the initial five months of 2011 due to these strategies.","Despite cartels' violence confined to particular areas, Mexico, with attractions like Cancun, upholds its appeal, attracting tourists from BRIC and drawing U.S. tourists with visa policies. Mexico's Deputy Secretary for Tourism speaks highly of these efforts which increased international visits by 2.1% within the first five months of 2011. Innovative strategies like U.S. visas' acceptance and visa-free internet permissions for Brazilians, Russians, and Ukrainians, significantly contributed to this growth.","Defying cartel violence limited to certain regions, Mexico lures BRIC tourists and opens doors for U.S. explorers with visa alterations. Cancun remains a prominent attraction. The initiative aids in a 2.1% influx of international visitors in early 2011, reinforced by authorities.

Three studies of Amgen Inc.'s version of these drugs, called evolocumab (ev-oh-LOKE-you-mab), found it lowered LDL or 'bad' cholesterol by 55 to 66 percent compared to a fake drug, and by nearly that much when compared to Merck's Zetia, another cholesterol medication. As impressive as that is, it's still just part of the picture. Doctors want evidence that the way these drugs lower cholesterol also will lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths, because that proof already exists for statins. New studies are underway to test this, but Amgen said it will seek approval for its drug this year based on cholesterol-lowering alone. That was enough to win approval for statins and Zetia, but use of Zetia has declined since 2008, when research showed it failed to help prevent heart attacks even though it cut cholesterol. Hopes are high that the new Amgen drug and others like it will do better. 'I would be happy to see it approved on the cholesterol results alone,' said Dr. Hadley Wilson, a cardiologist at Carolinas HealthCare System. 'We need additional agents other than statins"" to help patients,' he said. Nearly all current cholesterol medicines — fibrates, niacin and top-selling statins — are decades old. Statins such as Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor curb cholesterol production. Zetia, which came out about a decade ago, helps block the absorption of cholesterol from the intestine. The new drugs block PCSK9, a substance that interferes with the liver's ability to remove cholesterol from the blood. They have big drawbacks, though. Statins are pills sold as generics for as little as a dime a day. The new drugs are proteins rather than chemicals, and those tend to be very expensive to make. They also must be given as shots every two weeks or once a month. People can give the shots to themselves with a pen-like device. The companies developing the new medicines have not said what they might cost. 'We were very, very pleased about how well patients accepted the shots, and if they offer better results, especially for those with inherited conditions - people will accept it,' said Dr. Michael Koren of Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida, who helped lead two of the studies. The three Amgen studies involved about 2,000 patients in all. Doctors tested the drug in people with high cholesterol not taking other medicines, as a long-term (one-year) treatment in people already taking various medications and in combination with statins and other drugs in people with an inherited cholesterol disorder. In general, side-effect rates were about the same for evolocumab vs. placebo or Zetia. In some studies, muscle aches, nausea and a few other problems were a little higher with the experimental drug. Overall safety 'is very, very encouraging,' said Dr. Scott Wasserman, Amgen's executive medical director. Researchers also said: . —Alirocumab, a similar drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., lowered LDL cholesterol by 47 percent vs. 16 percent for Zetia in a study of about 100 people not taking any other drugs for high cholesterol. —Bococizumab, from Pfizer Inc., lowered LDL 45 percent to 67 percent, depending on dose, compared to placebo in 354 people with high cholesterol also taking a statin. 'There's great interest in all of these drugs, but doctors will wait for evidence that they lower heart risks,' said Dr. Neil Stone, a Northwestern University cardiologist and spokesman for the American Heart Association. It may be easier to justify their use in patients with genes that cause high cholesterol at an early age, he said. A spokeswoman for the federal Food and Drug Administration, Sandy Walsh, suggested that might be the case. 'Although we cannot comment on the likelihood of approval based solely on specific indications or populations,' two drugs recently were approved based on cholesterol-lowering for people with inherited conditions,' she noted. A decision on approval also will be influenced by how much the drug lowers cholesterol, its effects on other fats in the blood and other heart signs such as inflammation and blood pressure, and its safety, she said.","The article delves into the fascinating world of experimental medicines, specifically ones indicating a promising ability to dramatically lower cholesterol levels. The discussion unfolds around various studies, conferences as well as the multinational corporations involved in developing these drugs. Additionally, it presents an in-depth exploration of the benefits and potential drawbacks of such innovative methods. It also raises significant questions about the real-world implementation of these drugs, their cost effectiveness and their potential impact on patients' lives.","Novel experimental medicines show a prominent capacity to dramatically lower cholesterol, providing a new possibility for patients insufficiently aided by statin drugs like Lipitor.

"As an Olympic diver, there is no doubting he has a head for heights. But on this occasion, Tom Daley looked a little more apprehensive than usual. The 20-year-old diver was taking a ride on Falcon's Fury, the new ride at Florida's Busch Gardens theme park. The ride stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. And Tom's trepidation is probably understandable – it is ten-times higher than his usual diving board height. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee. Sophie starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global. Riders are seated upright and whisked to the top of the 335-foot tower before the seat pivots 90 degrees so the guest is looking straight down. The ride then plunges in a six-second free fall. Falcon's Fury stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60 mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. Riders plunge down in a six-second free fall . Tom described the ride as 'awesome'. Jeff Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said: 'It's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster. 'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.' Park officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee, who starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global . Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and even St. Petersburg, some 30 miles away from the top of the ride. Once riders get to the top of the tower, a computer program determines how long it stays at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge. Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds. During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia . Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure. A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas. The park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows. 'Drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld Magazine. Busch Gardens wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows . 'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. 'Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.' There are taller drop towers in the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California has a 400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it's constructed later this year. Both of those are attached to other rides. A famous drop tower is the Big Shot, the ride atop the Stratosphere hotel and casino in Las Vegas that catapults riders 160 feet in the air.","This article discusses the thrilling experiences of a well-known Olympic diver named Tom Daley at a theme park in Florida, notably on a particularly noteworthy ride termed 'Falcon's Fury'.

"(CNN) -- A massive typhoon crept across central Philippines on Sunday, sending thousands of people into shelters and pouring heavy rain that heightened the risk of flooding and landslides. Typhoon Hagupit -- its name means ""lash"" in Filipino -- moved west-northwest and targeted the city of Legazpi, just north of where the storm made landfall on Saturday. CNN's Saima Mohsin, reporting from Legazpi on Sunday, said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city. One of the city's major fears is a storm surge that could reach 2-4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet). With memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds, more than 600,000 people had evacuated by Saturday morning, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. About 40 million people are in the path of the storm's winds. Gen. Gregorio Catapang, chief of staff of armed forces, said at a Sunday press conference that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered. Eleven nations had offered assistance, including the Australia, the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain. He said 395 mm (15.5 inches) of rain were reported in Bororgan in 24 hours. Hagupit is moving slowly on its west-northwest track, at 15 kph (9.3 mph). At that rate, it will take about three days for the storm to travel past the capital, Manila, dumping extreme amounts of rainfall -- more than a foot in some places -- as it goes. Expected to lose some punch by Manila . Hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it reaches Manila, but winds will still be higher than 100 kph (60 mph). The biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall. That will lead to flash flooding and mudslides, even in places far away from the storm's center. Despite the threats of danger, a CNN crew in Legazpi saw many residents who were ignoring evacuation orders and vowing to stay in their makeshift beachside homes. ""I think we can handle the situation. If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center,"" one man said. ""We've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons,"" said a woman at the coast. ""This one already feels stronger than Typhoon Haiyan, but we won't leave yet."" The typhoon came ashore on eastern Samar Island just before 10 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) with winds of 205 kph (127 mph) -- the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. Town ravaged last year escapes major damage . One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday. In Tacloban, the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated. Last year, super typhoon Haiyan devastated Tacloban, killing more than 6,000 people and making around 200,000 people homeless. Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down. Many roads were flooded, but not impassable. About 48,000 people have moved to evacuation centers, he said; there have been no casualties. CNN's Asia-Pacific editor Andrew Stephens, reporting from Tacloban, said there was no storm surge. ""The main emotion here is one of relief,"" he said. Fishermen fears typhoon will ""destroy everything"" ""There was a lot of preparation,"" Orla Fagan, spokeswoman for the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, told CNN. ""I think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in Tacloban ... because there were so many lives lost, and I think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all-out effort everywhere to bring people to safety."" Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . CNN's Madison Park and CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller contributed to this report.","This article discusses the impact and aftermath of a substantial typhoon that swept across parts of the Philippines.

"Clubbers are being warned of the risk of overdosing on 'super strength' ecstasy, as tests reveal the drug's purity is at its highest level for ten years. Tests carried out on drugs which were seized during the summer show a huge rise in the amount of MDMA contained in the party drug. In one case, the government warned one batch had been tested to have about two-and-a-half times the standard MDMA dose - the active ingredient in ecstasy - per pill. Scroll down for video . Tests carried out on drugs which were seized this summer show the purity of ecstasy is at its highest level for ten years (stock image) It comes after the number of deaths caused by ecstasy soared from eight in 2010 up to 43 in 2013, according to the Office for National Statistics. The perceived rise in purity has prompted the Warehouse Project in Manchester (WHP), one of the biggest clubs in the country, to warn revellers about the dangers of increased purity before they visit the venue. Sacha Lord, director of WHP, said the concern was that those who are used to taking two or three tablets of a lower purity will continue to do so, potentially sparking fatal consequences. While the club says it does not condone drug-taking, it has started warning about 'very high purity' drugs in circulation on its Twitter feed. Nick Bonnie, 30, died after unknowingly taking almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before visiting the Warehouse Project, Manchester . Mr Lord told the Guardian: 'I would much rather warn people that the quality is that high and that it could cause all these issues if you take too much.' Fiona Measham, professor of criminology at Durham University, who regularly tests drugs, says the average ecstasy tablet now contains 100mg of MDMA. In 2009 the average ecstasy pill contained just 20-30mg. An 'acceptable' dose for an average-sized adult during one drug-taking session is 70-75mg, she says. Ms Measham said the increased purity of ecstasy was probably due to manufacturers developing new ways to synthesise the drug. Last year, WHP started warning customers of the dangers of PMA, a potentially lethal drug often sold under the banner of MDMA. Though no clubbers have been taken to hospital since the start of the season in September, about four of the 2,000 punters who attend each night end up being treated by on-site paramedics, mostly for drug-related issues. In an inquest earlier this month, the court heard how Prince's Trust worker Nick Bonnie, 30, died from ecstasy and cocaine poisoning. He unknowingly took almost 15 times the recreational dose of MDMA before entering the club, the coroner ruled. Tests showed a concentration of 4.42mg of MDMA in his blood. Typical recreational use normally measuring just 0.3mg. Anne-Marie Cockburn has called for a change to UK drug policy, after her daughter Martha Fernback died from taking a ecstasy tablet which was 91 per cent pure. The average is around 58 per cent . Earlier this year, Anne-Marie Cockburn, the mother of 15-year-old Martha Fernback, who died in 2013, called for drugs to be legalised. Martha, from Oxford, had consumed a dose which was 91 per cent pure. The average street purity is 58 per cent. Speaking after the inquest into her daughter's death, Miss Cockburn said: 'We need strict and responsible regulation. The Warehouse Project in Manchester (pictured) has started warning clubbers about the increased purity of ecstasy tablets . 'I'm not a radical person, this has been well considered and thought out. If we had that, Martha would have been able to make an informed decision. 'Martha wanted to get high, she didn't want to die - no parent wants either, but one of those is preferable to the other.' Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the inquest at County Hall in Oxford. He said: 'It is a terrible loss and I think we can only say that it may at least serve as a warning to young people who may take, or think of taking, ecstasy or MDMA. 'What is clear is that there is no way of knowing what it is made up of or what the purity level is. So, as I say, this is a very stark warning of what can happen.'","This write-up delves into an exceedingly sensitive issue related to followings of a certain subculture, which entails usage of a certain substance that's reportedly having its intensity at an alarming high.

"(CNN) -- Most sporting winners like to achieve champion status by proving their worth in the heat of battle but Austria's Marcel Hirscher had the cold to thank after he was all but guaranteed a second straight overall World Cup in Switzerland on Thursday. A combination of snow, wind and fog caused the cancellation of Thursday's super G in Lenzerheide, just a day after the downhill was scrapped for similar reasons, all of which prompted Hirscher's chief rival Aksel Lund Svindal to withdraw from this weekend's slalom. The Norwegian had hoped to narrow Hirscher's lead of 149 points in the two events he excels in but Svindal's World Cup hopes became decidedly frosty after these were canceled - since the Austrian is more adroit at the slalom. ""I see no point in competing in the slalom now,"" said the overall champion in 2007 and 2009. ""It might have been a consideration had the two races not been canceled. But that has not been the case."" Svindal's decision to miss Sunday's season-ending slalom means he cannot overhaul Hirscher's lead, with only 100 points awarded to the winner of any race. Slalom is not his strong point, with the 30-year-old having never done better than finish sixth in a World cup race in the discipline. Disappointed by his failure to pits his wits on the slope, the speedy Svindal was nonetheless quick to praise Hirscher -- classifying the Austrian in the same bracket as some of the best skiers in history. ""He had a fantastic season, worthy of great skiers of the past like (Sweden's Ingemar) Stenmark or (Italy's Alberto) Tomba,"" added the Norwegian. Even though he was disappointed by the cancellation of Thursday's races, the move did confirm Svindal as the winner of this year's super G. The day went badly for organizers with an initial delay of over three hours for bad weather followed by another postponement after the first racer, Gauthier de Tessieres, fell in high winds. Nine racers managed to finish despite the gusting winds before Kroell, last year's downhill World Cup winner, crashed at the same spot as De Tessieres fell before being flown to hospital after 45 minutes of on course treatment for a broken shoulder. Hirscher told reporters it was difficult to celebrate his impending triumph on a day when his fellow Austrian, who received a tweet of support from his compatriot, had been so badly injured. ""Despite my young age, I've already learned many things. In life, being slalom world champion is not the most important thing,"" the 24-year-old said in philosophical fashion. ""There are things that surpass that -- such as my family, Laura (his girlfriend), my friends and being healthy."" Tina Maze was another left with mixed emotions, despite the fact that the Slovenian took her third crystal globe of the season on Thursday, adding the super G to the overall and giant slalom cups. This came just 24 hours after she lost out on the World Cup downhill crown to America's Lindsey Vonn in similar fashion, with bad fog canceling the race with the Slovenian trailing by just a single point. ""I don't really like this kind of days when you don't get the chance to show your skills on the slope,"" she told the official FIS website. ""But in the end today is a good day for me, while yesterday wasn't really. I'm of course happy to secure the Super G title. I'm really proud of my season."" ""I'm relieved that we didn't race today. Conditions were really tough. In my opinion speed events should be canceled before one o'clock. Waiting for too long puts you in a stressful position and the risk of accidents therefore becomes higher.""

"A freak stroke of bad luck turned a Florida high schooler's serious but treatable injury into a situation so severe it required the boy's leg to be amputated. Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured  in a game against Clearwater High School on Friday night. He was rushed to an area hospital, where doctors would discover that the injury had caused a circulation-strangling clot behind his knee that would soon cost him a limb. Freak accident: Leshawn Williams, a 17-year-old defensive lineman at Northeast High School in St. Petersburgh, was injured in a game Friday night, leading to his leg amputation . Tense moments: It was clear from the start that Williams' injury would require immediate treatment Friday, but no one would have guest just how serious as he was wheeled off the field. Here, Williams is seen being wheeled off the field as his teammates looked on Friday . Couldn't feel his toes: Blood clots in the defensive lineman's knee caused blood to stop flowing to Williams' right lower leg . His injury was serious from the start and caused a half-hour delay in the game before Williams was taken off the field in a stretcher. When he arrived at the hospital, he complained he was in pain, but more importantly that he couldn't feel his toes. Doctors spent the weekend attempting to get the blood flowing back into the limb, the Tampa Bay Times reports. The decision to amputate below the right knee was made Sunday. Williams' mother Bonita Copeland said she didn't tell her son about the amputation until the surgery was over and that he continues to come to terms with the loss of his leg. 'It was a freak accident and it could've been something worse,' Copeland said. 'Even though my son lost his leg, I'm happy he's still here.' So what was so freakish that a teenage athlete lost a limb? One expert told the Tampa Bay Times that Williams' injury sounded like 'compartment syndrome.' Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which are groupings of muscles, nerves and blood vessels within joints. Broncos safety Rahim Moore nearly lost his leg from such an injury in 2013. However, compartment syndrome is rarely seen in football players. Williams' coach Jeremy Frioud told The Tampa Bay Times on Monday that the surgery was successful. His teammates planned to wear stickers bearing his number '69' at the next game in his honor. Williams mother first believed her son had injured his medial collateral ligament or MCL, which would not have been uncommon for a football player. She said she didn't reveal the amputation to her son until after the surgery. Here, a gurney is seen before it was used to wheel Williams off the field . Though only rarely seen in football players, an injury-induced ailment called 'compartment syndrome' has been known to cause athletes to lose a limb. Compartment syndrome develops when swelling or bleeding occurs within a compartment, which the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons says can be caused by athletic exertion or an impact injury. Broncos safety Rahim Moore underwent emergency surgery in 2013 to staunch bleeding in the muscle sheath in his lower left leg, a condition known as lateral compartment syndrome. Moore's surgery was successful and he's since returned to the field. Some fare better: Broncos safety Rahim Moore (26), here catching an interception against the San Diego Chargers, suffered from a form of compartment syndrome that nearly cost him his leg in 2013 .","The article details the unfortunate series of events that led to a high school football player in Florida suffering an injury severe enough to necessitate the amputation of his leg.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded Wednesday that it's 'possible' convicted felons could become Obamacare 'navigators,' gaining access to tax information and Social Security numbers of Americans as they help them register for insurance coverage. Her admission came during a Senate Finance Committee hearing, in a tense exchange with Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn. 'Isn't it true that there is no federal requirement for navigators to undergo a criminal background check,' Cornyn asked her, 'even though they will receive personal – sensitive personal information from they individuals they help sign up for the Affordable Care Act?' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius conceded that criminals could be helping Americans fill out health insurance applications, gaining access to the tax information required to determine their eligibility for government subsidies . Round Two: Sebelius faced an unexpectedly harsh grilling at the hands of Senators. Last week, she got a similarly hostile welcome in front of congressmen . 'That is true,' Sebelius responded in a moment of nervousness. 'States could add an additional – um – background checks and other features, but it is not part of the federal requirement.' 'So a convicted felon could be a navigator,' an annoyed Cornyn followed up, 'and could acquire sensitive personal information from an individual, unbeknownst to them?' 'Uh, that is possible,' she said, shifting blame to the groups responsible for deploying navigators in the field. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Four Pinocchios' Much of Wednesday's hearing focused on President Obama's now-debunked promise that Americans who like their health care plans would be able to keep them after Obamacare went into effect -- a promise that The Washington Post called a 'whopper' Line of fire: Sebelius faced calls to resign over the shambles by Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts . 'We have contracts with the organizations, and they have taken the responsibility to screen their individual navigators, and make sure that they are sufficiently trained for the job.' Sebelius also mentioned 'a self-attestation' that navigators are expected to sign, confirming their identities and their intentions. 'But it is possible.' President Obama is headed to Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, where he will promote the navigator program, a feature of Obamacare that allows paid assistants, many from community organizing groups cast in Obama's historical mold, to help Americans with their enrollment. Despite the administration promoting the navigators as an alternative means of registration to the program's semi-functional website, they too must use the website to determine whether or not applicants are eligible for federal government subsidies. March to the gallows: Sebelius faced unusually tough questions from a typically more sedate Senate Finance Committee panel, with one member calling for her resignation . Under questioning from Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, Sebelius tried to qualify her startling admission about information security under Obamacare. 'The navigators must go through a minimum of 20 hours of training,' she said. 'A significant portion focuses on privacy and security issues.' She insisted that applying for insurance under the new law 'there is no personal health information ever collected or needed, so they don't have access to that.' But Isakson countered that 'to estimate the subsidy somebody's going to get under the Obamacare law, you'd have to know their income on their tax return.' 'Are the navigators going to be able to use that information in order to make that estimate?' 'If a consumer chooses – yes – to share that information,' she replied, 'they can give the consumer the information about what they qualify for.' Sen. Pat Roberts, a Republican from Sebelius' home state of Kansas, called for her resignation over the botched Obamacare website rollout.","This article discusses extensively the interesting interplay between political figures and their roles within key developments of healthcare legislation.

"A Canadian nun was abducted by a gang of armed kidnappers in the early hours of Saturday while working as a missionary in Cameroon.

"(CNN)He runs his terror group like a CEO -- with spreadsheets on missions, assassinations and captured assets. And reports from Iraq's government suggest ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been hit in airstrikes over the weekend -- though it's not clear whether he was wounded, whose strikes he may have been hit by and in what part of the country he may have been struck. But if al-Baghdadi is dead, what would happen to the radical Sunni militant group? Don't expect ISIS to just crumble. ""It will morph, and new leaders will emerge,"" retired U.S. Maj. Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks said. ""In fact, bear in mind that ISIS leadership originated from Saddam's military. These are very conventionally trained, very professional leaders."" Odds are al-Baghdadi or the Shura Council, which handles the group's religious and military affairs, has planned this scenario in advance. ""ISIS likely has a clear line of succession,"" said Lauren Squires of the Institute for the Study of War. ""This is a bureaucratic organization with a deep bench ... either Baghdadi has signed off on the line of succession himself or the Shura Council has agreed to a line of succession."" Top two deputies . Al-Baghdadi has a Cabinet of advisers as well as two top deputies -- Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, who oversees ISIS' mission in Iraq, and Abu Ali al-Anbari, who is in charge of operations in Syria, according to the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. Both men are veteran Iraqi military officials who served under Saddam Hussein. ""These people who had previously served in Saddam Hussein's army were extremely brutal because Saddam Hussein's regime was very brutal,"" said Peter Neumann of King's College. ""But they also inherited the disciplines and the military skills that are now benefiting ISIS in its campaign against its enemies."" Analysts say al-Turkmani could make a strong case to become the leader of ISIS if al-Baghdadi is taken out. ""He would also have had to have a lot of outstanding qualities either in the political or the military field, and that certainly makes him a potential contender,"" Neumann said. Beneath each deputy are 12 governors for both Iraq and Syria. Those governors handle financial, military, legal, media and intelligence councils, among others. What's interesting about the bureaucratic hierarchy of ISIS is that it looks a lot like those of some Western countries whose values it rejects -- except there's no democracy involved and there's a council tasked with considering who to behead. Another possibility . Then there's Syrian Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the chief spokesman for ISIS who could also take over the group. In September, al-Adnani called for ISIS supporters to launch lone-wolf attacks. Analysts say some of al-Baghdadi's top deputies were imprisoned with the spokesman at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run detention center in Iraq where al-Baghdadi was also held for at least four years. ""He was able to trust these individuals as sharing his ideology, sharing his hatred for the West.,"" Squires said. The Shura Council's importance . If al-Baghdadi is still alive, there's one group of people who can take him out even without the use of airstrikes or violence. The Shura Council is the religious monitor for ISIS. Not only does it make sure all the local councils and governors are sticking to ISIS' version of Islamic law, it has the ability to stand up to al-Baghdadi. ""The Shura Council has the right to tell Baghdadi to go if he's not adhering to ISIS' religious standards,"" said Jasmine Opperman of the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. ""It would most probably never happen, but the fact that it's possible indicates the council's prominence."" She said the recent beheadings of Western hostages James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and David Haines would have fallen under the Shura council's purview. On top of that, Opperman said, the Shura Council also has the power to censure the leadership for running afoul of its interpretation of Sharia law. But what happens if al-Baghdadi dies might just be hypothetical for now. While some Iraqi officials say the ISIS leader was wounded in an airstrike, U.S. officials say they can't confirm whether al-Baghdadi was hit at all. CNN's Dugald McConnell, Nick Thompson, Atika Shubert and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","This article discusses the hypothesis of what could possibly transpire to a prominent terrorist organization, ISIS, upon the alleged elimination of its main leader.

"(CNN) -- The early Friday release of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was one of the most eagerly anticipated movie events of the summer. On Thursday, movie ticket seller Fandango reported that the last installment in the Christopher Nolan-directed Batman trilogy was ""outpacing summer blockbuster 'The Avengers' in ticket sales at the same point in the sales cycle."" ""The final chapter of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy has sold out on Fandango more than 2,000 showtimes nationwide and it's currently on track to become one of Fandango's top-selling movies of all time,"" the ticket seller reported. An attack by an armed gunman in Aurora, Colorado, at a midnight screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" was met with shock and grief throughout the country, and cast a shadow over what for fans was set to be a blockbuster weekend. Gunman kills 12 in Colorado movie theater . Experts said it's difficult to determine what, if any, effect the tragedy may have on either ticket sales or fan turnout in the days and weeks to come. ""For somebody to go into a movie theater, a place of fun and escapism, and bring that kind of violence into that world is shocking and tragic,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box office division of Hollywood.com. ""How this will affect the movie, I just don't know."" Shooting turns movie into surreal horror . According to Exhibitor Relations, the film did brisk business for its midnight screenings, raking in $30.6 million. Many fans had pre-purchased tickets for screenings across the country. Dergarabedian said the current focus has been rightfully on those injured and killed because of the violence. Beyond that it is up to Warner Bros., the studio that released the film, to decide how to proceed with marketing in the wake of the tragedy, he said. Theater shooting unfolds in real time on social media . Warner Bros., which is owned by the parent company of CNN, has been heavily marketing the action film that includes scenes featuring lots of gunplay and violence. A full-page newspaper ad heralding the opening weekend contains a pull quote from Marlow Stern, assistant culture editor of Newsweek, which says, ""A monumental conclusion to the epic trilogy. Audiences will be blown away."" Warner Bros. pulled the trailer for the film ""Gangster Squad,"" which had been running before showings of ""The Dark Knight Rises."" That film trailer features scenes of men armed with machine guns attacking a movie theater. A representative for the company told CNN that Warner Bros. did not plan to cancel any screenings. Thelma Adams, contributing editor for Yahoo Movies, said the tragedy poses a conundrum for the studio. ""I know people at Warner Bros. who were called and woken up this morning who now have a huge problem on their hands,"" she said. ""I think in the long run, a lot of the money is made globally with a movie like this and that will not have an impact."" Theater offers 'perfect killing' zone, expert says . Adams continued, ""Also it's not just an opening weekend movie. There (are) no other movies kind of in competition this weekend as a lot of other movies stepped off this weekend and next weekend. Yes, there will be some impact of the revenue stream, but it's not going to really hurt."" Warner Bros. canceled the film's planned premiere in Paris on Friday and released the following statement: ""Warner Bros. and the filmmakers are deeply saddened to learn about this shocking incident. We extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time."" An official with Paris police told CNN there was a police presence outside the Bristol Hotel, where cast members of ""The Dark Knight Rises"" were staying before the premiere, to ""protect all those who could be threatened."" Actor Gary Oldman, who portrays Commissioner Jim Gordon in the film, said in a statement, ""My prayers and deepest sympathies are with the victims and their families of this horrific act."" Scott Beggs, managing editor of the website Film School Rejects, said the film franchise has been popular because ""at the heart of (the film) is a central heroic figure that gives hope to people."" In Aurora, the agonized seek answers . Beggs pointed out that the death of actor Heath Ledger from a toxic combination of prescription drugs in 2008 cast a bit of a pall over ""The Dark Knight,"" but did not taint the legacy of what went on to become a critically acclaimed film. Ledger was posthumously awarded an Academy Award for best supporting actor for his role as The Joker in that movie. ""(That second film) was touched by tragedy, but I believe the art ended up speaking for itself,"" Beggs said.

"Greenpeace has sent its Rainbow Warrior ship to obstruct the removal of the Costa Concordia from the coast of Italy. Two and a half years after the cruise liner struck rocks and sank off the island of Giglio, killing 32 people, authorities are finally preparing to remove it.

Greenpeace Italy has said there are 'nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks' Luca Lacoboni, of Greenpeace Italy, said: ‘We cannot permit another environmental disaster. ‘To drag the wreck to Genoa would mean five days at open sea. The environmental risks are enormous in terms of leaking of poisonous fluids from the ship and in terms of the structure breaking down. ‘There are nearer ports that can be reached easily and with less risks.’ Genoa beat off many other contenders including ports in Turkey and the UK to win the lucrative contract, which will provide hundreds of jobs over two years. A spokesman for Costa Cruises said that technical and . engineering assessments have confirmed that the wreck removal plan was safe, . even in severe weather conditions. 'The wreck will be towed at low speed – average of 2 . knots - and will be escorted by other vessels, with equipment and specialised . personnel, including a team of marine biology experts and marine mammal . observers, ready to intervene should any problem arise.'

"(CNN) -- Spanish soccer giants Real Madrid increased the value of their club by 76% over the past year to usurp Manchester United as the world's most valuable football team. A study by financial experts Forbes found that Real Madrid's value now stands at $3.3 billion, knocking the English Premier League champions elect off the top of the list for the first time since the study began in 2004. Confounding the increasingly difficult economic conditions in Spain, Real, managed by Portuguese coach Jose Mourinho, have increased revenues to $650 million. Their operating income of $134 million is second only to the $227 million amassed by the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, which is the highest of all sports teams. Manchester United, on the brink of securing a record 20th English top flight title, increased their value by 42% to $3.17 billion, according to Forbes. Despite dropping to second behind Real, United have boosted revenues with a share issue and by signing bumper sponsorship deals. Their seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with U.S. car giant Chevrolet is worth $559 million while an eight-year agreement with insurance firm Aon is thought to be worth $230 million. All England's top flight clubs have been boosted by an increase in television revenue with the combined domestic and overseas rights having the potential to top $6 billion, Forbes say. Real's arch rivals Barcelona are third on the list with a value of $2.6 billion, English club Arsenal lie fourth on $1.32 billion while German champions Bayern Munich sit fifth on $1.3 billion. The top 20 clubs, all but one of which are European, are worth an average of $968 million, which is up 26% on last year. David Beckham, who now plays for French club Paris Saint-Germain, is again the best-paid soccer star with earnings of $50.6 million while Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo is second on $43.5m. Barcelona's Lionel Messi is third on $40.3m. Forbes say they value teams by calculating their ""enterprise values (equity plus debt) that are based on multiples of revenue that teams garner from television, premium seating, media, licensing, merchandise and concessions."" But speaking to CNN, sports business expert Simon Chadwick questioned the relevance of measuring value in this way. ""Real Madrid, Manchester United and Barcelona are all in the top-10 list of the most indebted clubs in the world, even if their revenue streams are healthy and strongly established,"" he said. ""The implication of measuring value in this way seems to be that many clubs in the top-10 are simply buying their success by signing players, building debt and winning trophies. ""It will be interesting to see the extent to which the UEFA Financial Fair Play initiative moderates valuations in coming Forbes league tables."" UEFA's new rules are designed to make Europe's clubs live within their means and attempt to break even each year, though there is an allowance for debt in the initial stages of their strategy. Chadwick believes the figures underline just how immune soccer is to the financial difficulties being experienced in Europe. He says the upward spiral shows no signs of abating. ""While football clubs clearly have tremendous financial value and commercial potential, some of the figures being reported here are staggering,"" he added. ""For Real Madrid to almost double its financial value in 12 months is incredible, especially set against the backdrop of economic austerity (particularly in Spain) and competition from other sports and industrial sectors. ""If these figures are a truly accurate and rigorous measure of value, then they are stunning. Even at the top-end of the game, clubs are relatively underdeveloped as commercial entities. ""With changes in management practice, a stronger commercial emphasis, and global marketplace development, then one can only speculate how much further the value of top clubs might increase.""","This article discusses a study conducted by Forbes that highlights the financial growth of international football clubs.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:48 PM on 24th November 2011 . Squatters have taken over a £5 million house in one of the most exclusive postcodes in London - because they 'can't afford' rents in the capital. The group of Eastern Europeans moved into a large Victorian house in Highgate, north London, two weeks ago, close to the homes of supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law. They pinned a notice to the front window of Hillcrest Lodge claiming 'squatters' rights' under the Criminal Justice Act. Valued by local estate agents at around £5million, it is directly opposite historic 18th century pub The Bull, which also became home to squatters at the end of last year.

However, . in a legal notice the squatters threaten him with legal action if he . attempts to enter the building, stating: 'Any entry into these premises . without our permission is a criminal offence as any one of us who is in . physical possession is oppose to such entry.' Farukl . Islam, who has owned adjoining restaurant Kiplings for 20 years, says . he called officers after he noticed six Eastern European men moving into . the property. He said: 'I . saw some boys, about 18 or 19-years-old, Eastern Europeans, moving in. I . called the police and they said to me ""it's none of your business"". 'They . don't come out in the day time but I have seen them going in and out at . night. I am worried about how this will affect my business because I . don't know who these guys are. I don't know if they are good guys or bad . guys. If they stay it is going to be a big problem for us.' Mr . Islam said the property used to be owned by Haringey Council and was . split up into flats before being bought by a property developer two . years ago. Too expensive: The occupants claimed they had been forced to squat in the house after being unable to afford rents in the capital . The developer began works on the building before being forced to stop when the recession hit, it was claimed. Mr Islam said: 'He came in to see me last week and asked what happened. I told him what I had seen.' A . 24-year-old Polish occupant of the property claimed she had been forced . to squat in the house after being unable to afford rents in the . capital. The woman, who . did not want to be named, said: 'You have two types of squatters. Some . people rush into these houses, but we are not that type of person. 'The owner, she knows we are here, so everything is sorted, and no-one suffers.' She added: 'We always try to find buildings which are empty and abandoned. 'We have so many empty buildings which are just not in use and no one living in them. Why? It is a big waste. 'My . friend is a single mum and she was waiting for a very long time to get a . council flat. She was living in a squat because she couldn't afford to . pay rent and make money.

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . US aviation officials have banned all American airlines from Syrian airspace in a notice that cites the threat of armed extremist groups who are equipped with anti-aircraft weapons. The Federal Aviation Administration had previously warned against flying in airspace over the war-torn country in the Middle East, but had not prohibited them. In an updated notice, the aviation authority said the change was based on updated assessment of risk and the lack of requests from carriers wishing to fly over Syria amid the unrest. The FAA has banned all US airlines from flying over Syria due to the ongoing armed conflict . The notice reads: ‘The ongoing armed conflict and volatile security environment in Syria poses a serious potential threat to civil aviation. ‘Armed extremist groups in Syria are known to be equipped with a variety of anti-aircraft weapons which have the capability to threaten civilian aircraft. ‘Opposition groups have successfully shot down Syrian military aircraft using these anti-aircraft weapon systems during the course of the conflict.’ The notice also cites previous threats from opposition groups, who have warned airlines to avoid flying into Syria. The FAA said: ‘Due to the presence of anti-aircraft weapons among the extremist groups and ongoing fighting in various locations throughout Syria, there is a continuing significant potential threat to civil aviation operating in Syrian airspace.’ The UK Civil Aviation Authority has issued its own warning about the dangers of flying within or near Syrian airspace, but it has not implemented a ban. The FAA says there has been a lack of requests from carriers wishing to fly over Syria amid the unrest . Very few airlines continue to fly over Syria. Data from FlightRadar24, a flight-tracking website, showed a handful of Syrian Air and Middle East Airlines flights operating regularly this month. In July, Malaysia Airlines faced criticism after it rerouted a flight over the country, just days after one of its planes was downed by a ground-to-air missile in eastern Ukraine. The FAA’s order was released as Small Arms Survey, an international research group that tracks the global flow of weapons, released a report that says armed groups in Syria have several hundred portable anti-aircraft missiles in their arsenal. The missiles could be used to destroy low-flying commercial planes, the report warns. Civil war: A report by Small Arms Survey warns about the threat of anti-aircraft missiles in Syria . Many airlines have already been avoiding airspace over conflict zones in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine. Carriers have been taking greater care since Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down over the conflict zone in Ukraine last month. All 298 people aboard the passenger jet were killed. Earlier this month, the FAA barred US airlines from flying over Iraq as the armed conflict there intensified and the US launched airstrikes targeting militants belonging to the Islamic State.","This article discusses the recent decision made by U.S. aviation officials to restrict American airlines from operating within Syrian airspace. Through a rather verbose delineation of the circumstances underlying this decision, the content explores the implications of anti-aircraft threats from armed extremist groups and offers an extended commentary on the historical context of these developments. It also thoughtfully elaborates on the potential danger posed to civil aviation, particularly referencing an updated notice from the Federal Aviation Authority, and concludes with an exploration of international responses to the ongoing situation.","US aviation officials have imposed a ban on American airlines in Syrian airspace due to the threat from anti-aircraft-armed extremist groups.

"Dafniya, Libya (CNN) -- Libyan rebels and troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi shelled each other for hours on Saturday in clashes at the highly contested frontline of Dafniya, an embattled town just west of the besieged port city of Misrata. At least 11 rebels were wounded in the exchange of fire and treated at one of the two field hospitals in what has been the most active day in Dafniya this week, according to a CNN team. Heavy government shelling on Misrata and Dafniya began shortly after Gadhafi rallied his supporters in an audio message on state TV and threatened to take the fighting to Europe in retaliation for NATO's bombing campaign. ""As soon as Gadhafi's speech ended, they started shelling Dafniya and around midnight there was a salvo of about eight rockets inside Misrata itself, and it continues on the front this morning,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman, who was in Misrata Saturday. Gadhafi has vowed vengeance for NATO bombings in Libya. He said the Libyan military could be ""like locusts, like bees"" in Europe, potentially targeting homes and offices. ""You are mistaken, you are involved in a battle that you don't know what you are going to face, so withdraw and run away,"" Gadhafi told a pro-government gathering in Tripoli. ""Our people is able in one day to move the battle to the Mediterranean, and able to move the battle to Europe."" Gadhafi referred to NATO, which began bombing military targets in Libya after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution in March authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim on Saturday reiterated Gadhafi's call for vengeance. NATO's ""aggression is killing our children (and) Europe will have to face the consequences,"" he said. ""You will have people attacking Europe, joining terrorist organizations against Europe, and building a culture that makes legitimate all violence against Europe."" Ibrahim claimed rebel fighters ""have no popular support."" ""The rebels have no future,"" he added. ""They know it and they are terrified."" On Saturday,  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the NATO mission in Libya is on track, with pressure on Gadhafi mounting and the rebel forces growing stronger. ""We need to see this through, and we are in complete agreement that we will,"" she said alongside the Spanish foreign minister in Madrid Saturday. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said the United States was taking seriously the Libyan leader's remarks. ""Certainly this is an individual who's obviously capable of carrying out these kinds of threats,"" he told reporters. ""It's what makes him so dangerous.  But he's also someone who's given to overblown rhetoric."" He said the United States would continue to support NATO's mission of increasing pressure on Gadhafi to step aside. The events came one day after the African Union's special committee on Libya said it had officially presented a plan meant to help Libya find a way out of the current crisis. The proposal states that Gadhafi will not be part of the negotiation process, but stops short of saying he should step down. ""It is envisaged to convene, soon, in Addis Ababa, (Ethiopia) negotiations between the parties to discuss these proposals,"" the group said in a statement. Committee members have met with Gadhafi and opposition leaders over the past three months. Another African Union-led attempt to broker peace between Gadhafi and the rebels fell through in April. The French government was in talks with Libyan rebels about supplying them with weapons and ammunition, a Libyan opposition military spokesman in Misrata said Thursday. The French government has not confirmed the claim, which follows an acknowledgment earlier this week that its military has previously dropped light weaponry to rebels elsewhere. CNN's Ben Wedeman and David McKenzie contributed to this report.","This article discusses a protracted exchange of hostilities between two groups in a contested location in the Middle East region, which resulted in a number of casualties and stirred international response.

The aim is to release the animals back into the wild once they're strong enough. They're all vaccinated against Bovine TB, before they reduce human contact. Pauline said: 'We'll add another two to the group, we'll keep them together before release in autumn. 'When they're 12 to 16 weeks once they wean, they go down to the Millie Block, which is a separate building. 'After that they turn nocturnal, we feed them at night, then it's on to glassed enclosures when we just throw the food over to them and get them to revert to wild.'

Making clear his determination to . stick his economic plan, Mr Cameron said today: 'I want us to be the . party that actually levels with the British public and talks very . plainly and straightly about what needs to be done. 'The . fact is we have to find those spending reductions, and if we want to . avoid cuts in things like hospitals and school and the services that we . all rely on, we have to look at things like the welfare budget, where . we’re still spending, as a country, £80bn on working-age welfare.

David Cameron and his ministers will use the Tory conference to unveil a raft of policies in an attempt to boost the party's opinion poll ratings. They include: . Ministers are buoyed by improving economic figures, but are anxious about being seen to publicly predict 'green shoots' of recovery. George Osborne, the chancellor, said he thought the economy was 'healing'. Today, Mr Cameron said he could not predict the next set of economic figures, but was confident that the economy was being rebalanced. But others are more publicly optimistic. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond claimed that the public would see real economic improvement by 2014, provided the Euro remained stable. 'You won't find anybody, hardly anybody in the business community or in the financial community, who thinks that the economy is doing right now what the data tell us it is doing,' Mr Hammond told The Observer. Both the Conservatives and Liberal . Democrats have made clear that their election prospects in 2015 will . depend on the state of the economy. He admits he must do more to ‘explain’ what the government is doing. ‘You spend a lot of time governing and deciding, and you don’t spend enough time explaining. ‘And I think conference week is a real opportunity to get out there and explain.’ But he makes clear there will be no deviation from the need for tough decisions on the economy. Mr Cameron said: ‘I think the British public are extremely fair minded. ‘I . think they know that Britain faces difficult circumstances, they know . the hole that we’re in is quite a deep one, they know it takes time to . get out,’ he told the Sunday Telegraph. ‘Of course, there are things that . we’ve done that they don’t like, of course there are things they wish we . had done differently.

The sun shone on the first day of the Tory conference, as senior ministers struck a more upbeat tone on the state of the economy . The conference theme ‘Britain can deliver’ will focus on the economy and try to present a more upbeat vision of the future.

Strategists . hope that taking a tough line with Brussels will recreate the opinion . poll boost enjoyed by the Conservatives after Mr Cameron vetoed a new . treaty in December last year. The . PM today said he would block 'outrageous' attempts to increase the . overall EU budget in looming talks on spending for 2014 to 2020. 'If it comes to saying 'no' to a deal that isn't right for Britain, I'll say 'no',' he told The Sunday Telegraph. David Cameron claimed today that he had been bolder than Margaret Thatcher as he promised to block 'outrageous' EU demands for an even bigger budget . And he set out a 'bold thinking' idea which would split the EU budgets into one for the 17 eurozone nations and another for the 10 - including Britain - outside the single currency. In one of the most eye-catching announcements, Mr Cameron said the government would cap rises in rail fares. Train companies were going to be . allowed to raise the average price of regulated fares - which include . season tickets - by RPI inflation plus three per cent in January 2013 . and then again in January 2014. But . Mr Cameron said that the rise for the next two years will be limited to . RPI plus one per cent, or 4.2 per cent instead of the planned 6.2 per . cent. Some commuters will be over £200 better off over the two years. The PM insisted it was proof that he was not abandoning the political centre ground. 'Are the Conservatives deserting the common ground of British politics? Absolutely not. David Cameron announced that from January, season tickets will rise by 4.2 per cent, and not the planned 6.2 per cent . 'I think the common ground of British politics, right now, ought to be [doing] everything you can to fire up the engines of enterprise and aspiration to get the economy moving, while holding onto the things that people care about passionately, like the NHS. I think that is absolutely where we are.' But Mr Cameron ruled out cuts to benefits for wealthy pensioners. 'Let me be absolutely clear, . the promise that I made at the last election to Britain's pensioners . when I said we are not going to take away your winter fuel allowance, . your free TV licences, your free bus passes - that promise stands.' The Prime Minister also defended the decision to reduce the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p - seized on by Labour as a 'tax cut for millionaires'. 'The richest 10 per cent in our country are not only paying more in income tax, they are paying a greater percentage of the total income tax take than they ever did under Labour,' Mr Cameron said. But Labour's Michael Dugher renewed the attack on the Tories. 'David Cameron can't be a One Nation Prime Minister. He says one thing, but time and again does another,' Mr Dugher said. 'He says those at the top will need to pay more, but he is the man whose top priority is to cut taxes for millionaires, giving 8,000 people earning over £1 million a tax break of £40,000 this April.'","This article discusses the political dynamics during a significant week of the political calendar.

"Removing your tattoo increases the risk of skin cancer and is as dangerous as lying on a tanning bed, according to an expert.

"(CNN) -- It paid to be a ""Lost"" fan Tuesday night. That is, it paid $150. Four of the six numbers drawn in the estimated $380 million Mega Millions lottery matched the numbers immortalized by the Lost character Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes, who hit a $114 million jackpot off them -- only to be haunted by the same numbers in later episodes. Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number). Hurley's numbers were 4, 8, 15, 16, 23 and 42. Unnerved watchers of the hit television show must have been left wondering whether the Dharma Initiative had a hand in the drawing. If you played Hurley's numbers, you won $150, according to a payout table on the Mega Millions website, though the same table noted that fixed prizes such as the $150 one ""may be paid on a pari-mutuel basis and (be) lower than"" that amount. But at least two people fared better than Hurley after Tuesday night's drawing. Two tickets matched all six numbers, according to a news release from Mega Millions. Owners of those tickets, which were sold in Idaho and Washington, will split the jackpot.

"By . Hugo Gye . Fraud: John Darwin has been forced to pay the State £40,000 from his newly matured pension pot . The man who faked his own death in a canoe accident in order to claim life insurance was today ordered to pay back £40,000 in compensation. John Darwin has so far repaid just £121 of the £679,073.62 he gained from the scam, which he orchestrated with his wife Anne. But after two private pensions matured, Teesside Crown Court ruled that he would have to hand over thousands of pounds to the Crown. Darwin, 63, from Hartlepool, did not challenge the application by the Crown to have the money removed from his bank accounts. Although the pensions were legitimately earned by Darwin during his work as a teacher and a prison officer, officials were still granted access to them in order to pay off the money he owes to the State. Prosecutor Jolyon Perks said that the defendant would have to hand over any money he manages to earn in the future. 'We believe it sends a strong signal to those who seek to benefit from their criminal conduct that these orders have teeth,' he said. 'They will be pursued and they will be rigourously enforced. The Proceeds of Crime Act is intended to be draconian.' Anne Darwin, who has now split from her husband, has repaid more than £500,000 under a separate order, and still owes another £177,000. The couple were both jailed for fraud after it emerged that they had made a false claim on Darwin's life insurance even though he was still alive and living in Panama. Outside court today, Tommy Maughan from the North East Regional Asset Recovery Team said: 'I'm pleased with the outcome today - Mr Darwin has now seen first-hand the full force of the Proceeds of Crime Act legislation in action. 'It's a robust law that allows police and prosecutors to make sure those who have benefited from crime pay back what they owe until their debt is paid. Repayment: Darwin, pictured outside Teesside Crown Court today, still owes more than £600,000 . 'The court assessed how much John Darwin benefited from crime some time ago, and today they have taken into account recently identified assets which the Judge has agreed can be confiscated. 'His full benefit from crime has still not been paid off, and if he comes into any substantial assets in the future we will again consider asking the court to revisit the Confiscation Order granted against him in 2009. 'Criminals should be warned that even if assets are gained legitimately this legislation can be used and their crimes may just come back to haunt them.' Partner in crime: Anne Darwin was jailed for her part in her husband's life insurance fraud . John Darwin left his children heartbroken when he failed to return from a canoeing trip near his home in Seaton Carew on Teesside in March 2002. He was reported missing, and after the wreckage of his canoe was found the next day he was officially presumed dead - allowing his wife Anne to claim thousands in life insurance. She used the money to repay the couple's debts and wipe out their mortgage - but in fact, John was living next door the whole time. In 2006, they moved to Panama, where they bought a tropical estate which they planned to turn into a hotel specialising in canoeing holidays. However, the next year Darwin decided he had to come back into the open in order to secure a long-term visa to continue living in Panama. He walked into a London police station in December 2007 - to the shock of his sons, who had assumed him long dead. Although Anne initially pretended not to have seen him for five years, a photograph soon emerged of the couple together in Panama, and their scam was exposed. In July 2008, the Darwins were convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than six years in prison each.","This article discusses the fascinating and slightly unnerving tale of an individual referred to as 'John Darwin.'

"(CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama was expected to make headlines in Europe with her style and flair as she accompanied her husband to the Group of 20 summit, but it was a simple gesture that has set off a media frenzy. Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and first lady Michelle Obama embrace while meeting Wednesday in London. While meeting Britain's Queen Elizabeth II in London on Wednesday, the two women briefly embraced -- not your typical scene at Buckingham Palace. The British media called it everything from a breach of protocol to an extraordinary show of affection from the queen. The Times of London proclaimed it a ""touching moment,"" and the palace apparently agreed. ""This was a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between the queen and Michelle Obama,"" a palace spokeswoman said. CNN's Carol Costello talked about the moment Thursday with Charles Mosley, author of ""Blood Royal,"" on CNN's ""American Morning."" CNN: According to our tabloids in the United States, the meeting went really well. What's your take? Mosley: Absolutely. What is astounding is the picture of the queen with her arm around Michelle Obama and Michelle Obama's hand around the queen, too. But the queen made the first move. This is the most astounding thing because the queen is not known for being touchy-feely. Indeed, her son Prince Charles complained on one occasion that he wasn't given enough affection when he was a child. She's obviously a late developer. CNN: What's the big deal [about touching the queen]? Mosley: The big deal is that the queen is normally a sacred person. In monarchies, there's a sacredness that surrounds the sovereign, which is perhaps not known in republics, at least not all the time in the way that it is in a monarchy. She's been on the throne a very, very long time, and she is herself a very dignified person, all the more so because of her relatively short stature. Watch to see if ""hugging"" the queen broke protocol » . One of the things one saw yesterday was the way [President] Obama and Michelle towered over the queen and indeed Prince Philip. CNN: By the queen putting her hand on the small of Michelle Obama's back, does that signal friendship? The queen said something to Michelle Obama toward the end of the meeting about keeping in touch. Mosley: Certainly, keeping in touch is meant quite literally. Yes, it's a very significant gesture; she's not known for this kind of thing. amFIX: Your thoughts on Michelle Obama and the queen . CNN: Let's talk about the other gesture: the gift of the iPod. Some tabloids are calling it the ""i-Dud"" in the sense that this wasn't a great present to give the queen. What do you think? Mosley: Not a bad one at all. The queen is actually quite technologically advanced. She uses e-mail to a much greater extent than most members of the royal family and particularly much more than her son, who is a bit of a technophobe. CNN: [The queen gave the president a silver-framed photograph of herself and her husband.] Was it a recent picture of the queen and Prince Philip at least? Mosley: That I don't know. If it's the same as she gives everybody, it must be a sort of middle period picture because it would have to cover so many years. On the other hand, it may well be that this gesture of terrific friendship and affection for Michelle Obama was her way of saying, ""Sorry, I should have given you something more personal.""","The current article, in a most articulate manner, examines the events surrounding a notable high-profile meeting between certain significant figures in global society.

Scientists have invented an edible gel that swells in the stomach and produces a feeling of fullness. The substance is believed to be difficult to digest - leaving the person feeling less hungry and so reducing their desire to snack or overeat. Discovery: Scientists have discovered a way of forming an edible gel that and produces a feeling of fullness . The researchers at the University of Birmingham made the discovery while combining various food ingredients, according to The Sunday Telegraph. The ingredients - derived from seaweed, starch and citrus peel - form water soluble gums that can be utilized as normal food thickeners. They are frequently used in molecular gastronomy by acclaimed British chefs, such as Heston Blumenthal. However, when exposed to stomach . acid, the ingredients start to swell and combine together to form a solid gel, according to the research published in the journal Food Hydrocolloids. Benefits: The substance is believed to leave a person feeling less hungry and so reduces their desire to snack . Scientists are now hoping to develop the substance so it can be incorporated into everyday foods. Project leader Jennifer Bradbeer said the discovery could help tackle Britain's obesity crisis - with a staggering 64 per cent of UK adults now classed as obese or overweight. 'One way of tackling the high and rising levels of . morbid obesity in today’s society is to control the consumer’s energy . intake from foods,' she told the newspaper. 'One problem is that foods have become softer, more easily digestible and therefore less satiating. 'This leads to the individual feeling hungry more quickly and subsequently wanting to eat again, often between meals.' She said that the gel - made of hydrocolloids that respond to the stomach's highly acidic conditions - could be one means of curbing a person's cravings for snacks. However, she added that while the gel alone could provide 'prolonged satiety', it would result in 'unpleasant sensations' if lacking the energy provided by food. More than 1.4billion people across the world are now classed as obese or overweight, according to a recent study by the Overseas Development Institute. People who are classed in these categories are at greater risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancers, diabetes and other health-related issues.","This article discusses a fascinating scientific breakthrough that may shake the very foundations of our ever-expanding understanding of food science.

"Birth dearth: Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But experts say it is not working . Germany is battling a baby drought that has caused its population to plummet, leaving a rash of vacant homes, dry sewers and fears the economy may crumble, experts have warned. In its most recent census, Germany discovered it had lost 1.5 million inhabitants and, by 2060, experts say the population could dwindle by an extra 19 per cent, to about 66 million. Between 2000 and 2013, Germany's . birth rate dropped by 11 per cent compared to rises in the UK (4.3 per . cent), France (3.6 per cent), Spain (12.8 per cent) and Ireland (8.9 per cent). Now panic is beginning to spread through Europe's economic powerhouse as the financial crisis continues to stretch its tentacles into all aspects of society, especially the country's labour market. Adding to the country's woes, a recent study by Europe's Population Policy Acceptance Study found that 23 per cent of German men thought 'zero' was the ideal family size. 'In some areas, there are now abundant overgrown yards, boarded-up . windows and concerns about sewage systems too empty to work properly,' reports the New York Times. 'The work force is rapidly graying, and assembly lines are being . redesigned to minimize bending and lifting.' Policy makers are now throwing money at families in a bid to stem the birth dearth and encourage citizens to have more babies. But despite spending $265 billion a year on family subsidies, experts say the government is not doing enough claiming Germany needs an overhaul of values, customs and attitudes. According to the New York Times Germany has for many decades had a fraught relationship with immigration. To make matters worse, attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness. Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer and make itself more appealing to immigrants, who, they say, tend to find other European nations far more hospitable destinations. It also needs to feed more women into the workforce while, at the same time, encourage them to have more babies. 'If you look closely at the numbers, what you see is the higher the gender equality, the higher the birthrate,' Reiner Klingholz of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development told the New York Times. Keep working: Experts are now claiming Germany needs to find ways of keeping older workers in jobs for longer as fears grow for the country's workforce . But, he added, Germany has long subsidised families of a traditional set up, making change all the more difficult. 'Touching those is political suicide,' Michaela Kreyenfeld of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research told the paper. 'Women are perfectly integrated within Germany's labor market but when it comes to babies, everyone expects a mother to stay at home and take care of the children,' she told reuters last year. 'This of course deters women from becoming mothers.' Last year it emerged the number of births in Germany fell to a post-war low despite a raft of government incentives meant to reverse a population decline. 'Raven mother': Attitudes to working mothers remains unsympathetic in Germany where women who juggle jobs with children are commonly referred to pejoratively as 'raven mothers', implying neglectfulness . A third of all babies born in Germany, still the EU's most populous member state, came from immigrant families, the analysts said, noting that without them the overall figure would have been much lower. The preliminary data released by Germany's Federal Statistics Office showed 663,000 children were born in 2011, down from 678,000 in 2010. How Germany's birth rate compares to Europe (between 2000 and 2013): . 'As in every year since 1972, the number of people who died was greater than the number of children born. In 2011 the difference amounted to 190,000 people and in 2010 to 181,000,' the office said in a report. Demography experts have forecast that Germany's population could shrink to about 50 million by 2050, based on current trends, and say France and Britain - which now have about 60 million each - could overtake it later this century. Germany's birthrate peaked in 1964 when a total of 1,357,304 children were born in the capitalist West and communist East. West Germans were already having fewer children in the 1970s because of improving conditions for women and their easier access to education, said Reiner Klingholz, director of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development. 'So fewer children were born then, meaning that today we lack potential parents for potential children,"" he said.Without immigrant families, the number of newly born children in Germany would reach only 400,000 in a country of 82 million, Klingholz said. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has no children herself, introduced relatively generous child benefit payments in 2006, making it easier for women to return to the workplace after having children.In June 2012, however, in a move critics say entrenches a more traditionalist view of women's roles, Merkel's coalition also approved a bill on childcare payments that would give parents an allowance to keep their toddlers at home rather than sending them to nursery.","The article discusses the significant challenges that Germany is presently experiencing due to a drop in birth rates. Several strategies, including financial incentives, have been implemented to encourage a higher birth rate, yet these measures have been largely unfruitful thus far, according to experts. With stark figures detailing the population loss that has occurred and projections for future population decline, the piece posits a number of societal implications that could result from this demographic shift. Furthermore, it delves into the cultural attitudes in Germany that may contribute to this phenomenon.","Germany faces a demographic crisis due to declining birth rates, resulting in population loss and predictions of further decline, despite sizeable financial incentives to boost fertility rates. With societal repercussions looming large, cultural attitudes are highlighted as a key issue. Experts argue for a policy overhaul that examines deep-seated values, customs, and attitudes, hinting at a need for attitudinal shift toward working mothers, and ingrained notions about family size and child-rearing responsibilities.","Facing a population crisis due to falling birth rates, Germany is battling to reverse the trend with sizeable financial incentives, but this approach is failing. The ramifications are predicted to be vast, with societal issues becoming increasingly prominent. Experts argue that the heart of the problem lies in ingrained cultural attitudes, hinting at the need for an overhaul of policy to re-evaluate deep-seated values, customs and attitudes. They suggest an imperative shift in attitudes towards working mothers and evolving notions of ideal family size and childrearing roles.","Amidst a burgeoning population crisis, Germany grapples with plummeting birth rates despite substantial financial incentives to amplify them.

Alexis Sanchez capitalised on two Sunderland howlers to earn Arsenal a second away win of the season and move them to the edge of the top four — but improvement will be required to secure a Champions League berth. The first goal came courtesy of Wes Brown, who effectively passed the ball into Sanchez’s path with only keeper Vito Mannone between the South American forward and goal — and Sanchez duly snaffled the chance. The second goal, scored in the final moments to flatter the scoreline, was laid on a plate by former Gunner Mannone. The Italian was faffing around with the ball at his feet when he could have simply hoofed it clear and Sanchez simply nipped in, took the ball and scored.

Man of the match: Sanchez . The match as a whole was mediocre, Arsenal operating at training pace for long stretches and Sunderland desperate to make sure they did not succumb to a second successive monstering after being embarrassed 8-0 at Southampton last week. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger naturally took the positives at the end of a week in which he celebrated his 65th birthday with a late comeback victory at Anderlecht in the Champions League. ‘Of course I am happy because we had a difficult game on Wednesday night,’ he said. ‘I believe we were in control. Before scoring a second goal, of course you can concede a goal and drop points. We didn’t do it today, we were focused. ‘We won at Anderlecht and we won here, two and a half days later. That is never easy.’ Wenger praised Sanchez for the ability and talent that allowed him to make the most of the hosts’ errors. ‘He took advantage of the mistakes they made,’ Wenger said. ‘He has a super quality, he is quick on his feet. That’s why he wins many balls that normal players don’t win. ‘His transition from offence to defence is very quick and he wins the ball back very quickly and he can take advantage of that.’ This latest reverse for Sunderland leaves them with just a single win to go with five draws and three defeats. Manager Gus Poyet insisted he was heartened by the response to last week’s drubbing but was disappointed that individual errors had again been so costly. ‘It’s difficult to analyse the game because the commitment, reaction, desire and organisation compared to last week was there,’ he said. ‘But we forgot to leave the mistakes in the dressing room.’ Poyet also said his team were angry. ‘They fought hard for the result and two actions cost us.’ But he believes Sunderland’s problem is psychological rather than any technical or tactical issue. ‘We’re getting paid to win games and we’ve won one and need to change that,’ he said. ‘It’s about character now, being brave enough to go on the pitch and believe we can win.’ Poyet made two changes to his starting line-up, bring in Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson as Jordi Gomez and Connor Wickham dropped to the bench.

Alexis Sanchez              90           11.0      6.8 . Sunderland pushed forward at the start and had the first sight of goal in the second minute, Rodwell heading wide from Will Buckley’s cross. If that looked promising it was a false dawn because their only other efforts that carried threat in the first half were headers from John O’Shea and Rodwell, and both of those were blocked. Arsenal’s first chance was in the seventh minute from a corner taken by Santi Cazorla. It was headed clear only as far as Kieran Gibbs, but he lashed wide from the edge of the area. Cazorla fed Sanchez a minute later and he also shot and missed. At the other end, Brown nodded on to O’Shea, whose header was blocked. Then came the clearest chance up to that point of the match when Danny Welbeck, who received the ball on the left corner of the area, switched it on to his right foot and smacked the ball just over. Gibbs was booked for taking out Johnson, the first of a spate of yellows cards either side of the break, with Welbeck and Mikel Arteta among others to go into Kevin Friend’s book. Welbeck was booked for an alleged dive in the second half but it looked a harsh decision because his movement was impeded by O’Shea. Arteta’s booking five minutes after that was arguably lenient, for a high kick on Rodwell that might well have given him a facial injury. Arsenal went ahead in the 30th minute thanks to Brown’s error in the centre circle. First, he failed to control a simple pass from a team-mate and then he made a hash of an attempted back pass, twisting his kicking leg and making minimal contact with the ball. In doing so, he gave possession to Sanchez with nobody between the Chilean forward and the Sunderland goal. Sanchez dashed forward and chipped over Mannone. Cazorla had a chance to extend the lead three minutes later but his left-footed shot flew wide right. On the hour, Sanchez’s effort from outside the box forced a save from Mannone and then another former Arsenal man, Seb Larsson, elicited a save from Wojciech Szczesny at the other end. Jozy Altidore, on as a substitute for Rodwell, headed on target and Szczesny saved again. Sanchez rubbed Sunderland’s noses in it with his late second goal when Mannone was clearly at fault. ‘Vito has been educated at Arsenal so of course I have some sympathy,’ Wenger said. ‘He is like anyone else [at Sunderland], his confidence has dropped a little bit because of the defeat last week. But he has shown his qualities since he arrived here and will show that again.’ Arsenal must demonstrate their own, more clearly and more often.

"By . Ruth Styles . He might have a farmer for a father but Prince Harry looked slightly ill at ease when confronted with an enormous bull during a visit to the Suffolk County Show in Ipswich this afternoon. Nothing daunted, the royal carried on chatting to its owner - even when the Red Poll began to beadily roll its eyes.

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A man accused of playing a role in the 1968 hijacking of a Pan Am flight from New York to Puerto Rico was arrested Sunday, federal officials said. Luis Armando Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's JFK International Airport. Luis Armando Pena Soltren, 66, surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport after exiting a flight from Havana, Cuba, officials said. It's the same airport from which Pan Am Flight 281 took off more than 40 years ago. He flew to New York under the custody of State Department diplomatic security personnel, said a law enforcement source and a senior State Department official. Authorities did not offer additional details about Soltren's arrest. Soltren ""will finally face the American justice system that he has been evading for more than four decades,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. According to a December 1968 indictment, Soltren and three others -- Jose Rafael Rios Cruz, Miguel Castro and Alejandro Figueroa -- conspired to hijack Flight 281 on November 24 of that year. They were accused of bringing concealed guns and knives aboard and using them to take over the flight. Crew members told authorities at the time that the armed suspects forced their way into the plane's cabin and ordered the crew to fly to Havana, according to court documents. Cruz and Castro were sentenced in the 1970s after pleading guilty in U.S. District Court in New York. They received 15-year and 12-year sentences, respectively. Their current whereabouts were not immediately known. Figueroa was acquitted in 1969.

"By . Associated Press . President Barack Obama is the fourth sitting president to attend a D-Day anniversary observance in Normandy and the only president to visit the site of the allied invasion twice during his presidency for an anniversary commemoration.

Joining him were surviving members of an Army Rangers team that had scaled cliffs at Pointe du Hoc to silence German guns protecting the Normandy beaches.

France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (second from left) speaks with U.S. President Barack Obama, as they walk in front of Britain's Prince Charles (left), Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper (third from left) and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown (second from right) at Colleville-sur-Mer cemetery  before a ceremony to mark the 65th anniversary of D-Day on June 6, 2009 . Before him, presidents acknowledged the D-Day invasion with words or statements, but none made a pilgrimage to the site, not even Dwight Eisenhower, who had been the Supreme Allied Commander who ordered the invasion. Here is a sampling of how presidents observed the key D-Day anniversaries. DWIGHT EISENHOWER, 10th anniversary, 1954 . Issued a statement that reflected the Cold War chasm of the day: 'We see peoples, once bitter enemies, burying their antagonisms and joining together to meet the problems of the postwar world. If all those nations which were members of the Grand Alliance have not maintained in time of peace the spirit of that wartime union, if some of the peoples who were our comrades-in-arms have been kept apart from us, that is cause for profound regret, but not for despair.' Eisenhower did go to Normandy after his presidency, for the 20th anniversary observance. Former President Bill Clinton was in Normandy in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of the invasion of France . Former President George W. Bush, whose father is a World War II hero, went to Normandy for the 60th anniversary commemoration in 2004 . LYNDON JOHNSON, 20th anniversary, 1964 . Johnson, in Washington pushing for passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, delivered remarks to members of a D-Day delegation, headed by Gen. Omar Bradley: 'Your country remembers and will never forget, the resolve born on that D-Day, that, so long as we are able, and other men are willing to stand together, we shall not permit the light of freedom to be extinguished on any continent again. ... So let all the world know that when this nation has stood 2,000 years we shall not have forgotten the lands where our sons lie buried, nor the cause for which our sons died. Where we have commitments to the cause of freedom, we shall honor them — today, tomorrow and always.' RICHARD NIXON, 30th anniversary, 1974 . Nixon, in the throes of the Watergate investigation and with impeachment hearings underway, sent General Bradley once again to the ceremonies. Five years earlier, Nixon had issued a proclamation on the 25th anniversary calling the Normandy assault 'a historical landmark in the history of freedom.' He also met at the White House with former war correspondents who were on their way to France for the 25th anniversary observance.

RONALD REAGAN, 40TH anniversary, 1984 . Reagan spoke at the top of the cliffs of Pointe du Hoc, the Atlantic Ocean spread behind him and with 62 gray-haired surviving Rangers seated before him. 'They shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon, one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five came here. After two days of fighting, only 90 could still bear arms. 'Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the men who put them there.' BILL CLINTON, 50th anniversary, 1994 . Clinton attended the 50th anniversary, delivering his remarks at the U.S. Cemetery in Colleville-sur-Mer, France. His comments offer an ironic reference point to the Europe that Obama faces as he arrives in Normandy on Friday. 'Fifty years later, what a different world we live in. Germany, Japan and Italy, liberated by our victory, now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom. Russia, decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and cold war, has been reborn in democracy. 'And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev, the liberation of this continent is nearly complete. Now the question falls to our generation: How will we build upon the sacrifice of D-Day's heroes? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach, we cannot stand still. We cannot stay safe by doing so. Avoiding today's problems would be our own generation's appeasements. For just as freedom has a price, it also has a purpose, and its name is progress.' American veteran Frederick Carrier reads the names of soldiers who died landing on Utah Beach at Saint Marie du Mont . GEORGE W. BUSH, 60th anniversary, 2004 . Bush went to Normandy in 2002 to observe Memorial Day. He returned for the 60th anniversary, speaking at the U.S. cemetery and accompanied by French President Jacques Chirac. 'All who are buried and named in this place are held in the loving memory of America. We pray in the peace of this cemetery that they have reached the far shore of God's mercy. And we still look with pride on the men of D-Day, on those who served and went on. It is a strange turn of history that called on young men from the prairie towns and city streets of America to cross an ocean and throw back the marching, mechanized evils of fascism.' BARACK OBAMA, 65th anniversary, 2009 . Obama recalled that his grandfather, a 26-year-old supply sergeant stationed near the English Channel, crossed the channel six weeks after D-Day and followed allied forces across France. 'At an hour of maximum danger, amid the bleakest of circumstances, men who thought themselves ordinary found within themselves the ability to do something extraordinary. ... That is the story of Normandy — but also the story of America; of the Minutemen who gathered on a green in Lexington; of the Union boys from Maine who repelled a charge at Gettysburg; of the men who gave their last full measure of devotion at Inchon and Khe San; of all the young men and women whose valor and goodness still carry forward this legacy of service and sacrifice.'","This incredibly in-depth article provides a rich historical commentary, discussing the tradition of sitting American Presidents attending D-Day anniversary observances in Normandy.

Undercover: Frenando Jara spent five years under the guise of a radical Muslim after the 9/11 attacks . It may sound far-fetched, but a California man says he lived a real life spy thriller when he became an unlikely secret agent. Fernando Jara, of Kern County, spent five years completely off the grid beginning in 2001 when the seemingly normal guy joined the ranks of America's most clandestine agency.

He had dropped out of high school, and at the time was working toward his equivalency degree at community college. Jara quickly got to work, traveling within California and to Virginia and Washington, DC, where he received training in Arabic, counter-terror tactics and weapons. He was also connected with David Manning of Ventura, California, who taught the then-26-year-old how to handle knives and guns. Manning told the LA Times: 'They said he was under the radar and getting ready to go to Afghanistan to infiltrate the Taliban. I told them, ""I'm not doing this."" I didn't believe them.' Jara credits Manning with turning him into 'a one-man army.' The next five years of Jara's life have remained a pretty guarded secret, but he tells the LA Times that he infiltrated numerous terror training camps in Yemen and Afghanistan while posing as a radical Muslim.

A robin had its feathers ripped out and was left for dead after being cruelly caught in a superglue trap. The little red bellied bird had attempted to wriggle free from the glue board, used to capture rats and rodents but had only succeeded in pulling lumps of its plumage out. Two boys discovered the robin chirping in distress and it was rescued by RSPCA officers. Stuck: Two boys discovered this robin chirping in distress after getting caught in a deadly superglue trap . The wildlife charity today called for a ban on the glue traps in which extra-strong adhesive is spread onto boards to catch vermin. It was designed not to dry or lose its stickiness so catches any animal which comes along and can cause them a slow, lingering death, an RSPCA spokesman said. The bird was found struggling by the side of Park Road in Hornsey, London, by the 12-year-old schoolboys. Inspector Natalie Bartle said: 'This poor little robin was a pitiful sight when I first arrived - very distressed and sticky all over. Without the caring attitude and diligence of these two young boys who knows how much longer it would have suffered? Injured: A grass snake died in a similar trap in Fore Street in Pinner, Middlesex, after its scales were damaged . 'It just shows how cruel and indiscriminate these traps can be.

"A three-month-old baby boy was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest heard. Mother-of-four Angela Williams brought the infant into her bed because she 'wanted to be with him', after separating from his father. She found three-month-old Bobby Blakemore unresponsive the next morning and despite attempts at resuscitation he was declared dead at the scene. Three-month-old Bobby Blakemore was found dead after sharing a double bed with his mother, an inquest in Bolton heard . The Bolton hearing was told Bobby was born prematurely at 34 weeks and had weighed 5lbs 3 oz, but had been feeding well and there had been no medical concerns. Miss Williams of Clifton, near Swinton, Greater Manchester, told the hearing her son had a routine in which he would wake up in the morning at around 7am. The company team leader said: 'I would wake up about 12 and then 3am, he always struggled to get back to sleep after the 3 o'clock feed.' On October 19 last year Bobby's father Liam Blakemore, an insurance worker, took him out before returning before 1pm. The youngster slept until 2.45pm before waking for a feed and was a 'bit sick.' After that he was said to be fine. Bobby had another feed at 6.30pm before being placed in his pram where he fell asleep. That evening Miss Williams was joined at her home by a work colleague and she had a glass of wine before going to bed - leaving her friend to sleep on her sofa. The inquest was told that Bobby did have a Moses basket but Miss Williams said: 'He didn't like sleeping in it, he had a crib in our room. 'That night I put him in our bed instead of putting him in the crib. I wanted to be with him. I was playing songs he liked listening to.' Little Bobby ,pictured with his father Liam Blakemore, had been perfectly healthy before he died . She said she lay on her back and put herself between Bobby and the adjacent bedroom wall and covered them both with the duvet. She woke at around 6am to find Bobby unresponsive . Despite mouth-to-mouth resuscitation attempts and instructions from a 999 operator, Bobby was pronounced dead at the scene. When asked by the coroner Alan Walsh if she had been aware of any overlying Miss Williams replied 'no.' She said that when she woke Bobby was in the same position in which she had left him. The NHS advise that the safest place for a baby to sleep in its first six months is in a cot in its parents room. They advise against sharing a bed if either parent is a smoker, has recently drunk alcohol, taken medication or drugs that make them sleep more heavily or are tired. They say the risks of sharing a bed with an infant are also increased if they were born premature or were of a low birth weight. The NHS say there is also a risk parents could role over in their sleep and suffocate their baby. Or the child could get caught between the wall and the bed, or roll out of an adult bed and be injured. She also said that he hadn't cried in the night. The pathologist who carried out the post mortem examination was unable to ascertain a cause of death for the child. Recording a narrative cause of death Mr Walsh said: 'It's accepted in some case that prematurity is a factor in sudden unexpected death. 'Although born prematurely Bobby did grow and thrive and that's largely due to the good care he was given by his parents. 'He was obviously well fed and cared for and well looked after by parents that cared and helped him to overcome the immediate dangers of prematurity. 'He was placed in bed with Angela because she wanted to be close to him that day. 'He usually slept in a crib, sadly he didn't disturb his mother that night and she found him in the morning unresponsive. 'It's important that some of the factors that arise in Sudden Infant Death Syndrome are given as a warning, there is nothing to suggest that is the cause of death. 'Prematurity is one of the factors, co-sleeping is another factor as well as overheating and smoking. I'm satisfied there was no smoking in the house. It is not right to reach any conclusion that these factors caused the SIDS. I make no comment other than that they exist and people should be aware of this.'","This article discusses the tragic incident involving the death of a 3-month-old infant, the circumstances leading up to the event, and the subsequent inquest.

"(CNN) -- New guidelines for the management of hypertension suggest that people 60 or older might be able to handle higher blood pressure readings than originally thought. Hypertension, which can lead to strokes, heart attack, kidney failure and death, is traditionally treated with medication and diet. The goal of most doctors is to keep their patient's blood pressure below 140 (systolic) / 90 (diastolic). But after reviewing mounds of evidence, a committee of experts now says the systolic number, especially in older people, can be higher at 150/90. And many of these patients who were on medication would no longer need to be. It is not clear how many people would be affected by these new guidelines, but experts are estimating in the millions. The committee was asked to update the guidelines that have been in place for more than 30 years. They were published online Wednesday in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association. The group of 17 experts found no reason to change any other section of the guidelines. According to the report, ""There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90. ""However, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 for those groups based on expert opinion.""","This article discusses the intricate topic of revised guidelines for hypertension management in certain age demographics, emphasizing an upward adjustment in permissible systolic blood pressure readings. This recalibration potentially redefines the need for medication in several patients.

"A father-of-five has been stabbed to death at a Wisconsin river following an argument with three other fishermen. Peter Kelly, a 34-year-old volunteer high school wrestling coach, was stabbed in the chest beside the St Croix River at 9.45pm on Tuesday as he fished with a friend. The two men were on the Minnesota side of the river when they heard three men being loud and rude on the Wisconsin side and asked them to quieten down, authorities said. For the next three hours, Kelly and his friend exchanged heated words with the three other anglers. Scroll down for video . Loss: Peter Kelly, 34, was stabbed in the chest after he and a friend asked a group of rowdy fishermen to be quiet at a river on Tuesday. The argument escalated and Kelly was attacked and died at the scene . 'The group on the Minnesota side was making statements like, 'Why don't you clean up your act',' . Captain Steve Smith with the Polk County Sheriff's Office in Wisconsin told CBS Minnesota. 'The challenge was made – 'why don't you come over here?'' Kelly and his friend drove to Interstate Park on the Wisconsin side, where the argument escalated and one of the men pulled out a knife and stabbed Kelly in the chest. He died at the scene. After the stabbing, the attackers fled the scene and authorities are still searching for them. The Polk County Sheriff's Office said the three men are believed to be in their late teens or early 20s and were with a dog named Gunnar, who was either a golden retriever or a yellow lab. They were traveling in two vehicles with Minnesota license plates: a blue Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck and a small passenger car. Left behind: Kelly and his wife Christie, pictured, have four sons and a daughter all under the age of nine . Authorities are also asking for help tracking down five people who were in the area at about 7.30pm as they have witnessed the argument that ultimately escalated. Now his small community in St Croix Falls, which has just 2,100 people, is mourning the loss of the family man who volunteered as a coach at the high school's football, baseball and wrestling teams. He would often go to work at 4am so he could get back in time to coach before dinner, fellow high school coach Dan Clark told the Star Tribune. His day job was at Andersen Windows in Bayport, where he worked in quality control. 'He worked 10 to 12 hours a day at Andersen Windows, and he would come home and volunteer four hours a night to our wrestling program for four or five months a year,' Clark toldFox9. 'He was one of the greatest human beings that I ever hoped to meet.' His wife, Christie, stayed at home to care for their children, who are all under nine. They have four boys, Kellen, Payton, Miles and August, and last year welcomed a baby girl, Molly. Devastated: His brother, Mike Kelly, said the man's children did not understand what had happened . Confrontation: Kelly and a friend were on the Minnesota side of the St Croix River, pictured, and told men on the Wisconsin side to stop making so much noise. Kelly was stabbed at Interstate Park . 'I don't think they fully understand the implications of what happened,' his brother, Mike Kelly, told KARE. 'His daughter will never even get to know him.' Friends and family added that they do not believe Kelly was to blame for the confrontation. 'He did good things, and did what was right all the time,' his brother added. 'And that's probably what cost him. Some knuckle heads swearing and being silly.' Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the Sheriff's Office at 715-485-8300.
