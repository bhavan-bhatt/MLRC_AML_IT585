With only days to go before his daredevil wire walk across the Grand Canyon without a safety harness and live on television, Nik Wallenda has released a stomach churning video of what his daring feat will involve. The sky walker is seen walking between two looming buildings in his home town of Sarasota, Florida, and fighting to keep his balance as giant fans are directed at him to recreate conditions at the Grand Canyon. Crowds of spectators have been gathering every day to watch as Wallenda and his team practice for  his 1,200ft walk without tethers or safety nets about 1,500ft above the Little Colorado River on Sunday.

For two weeks, the holder of a half-dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of Niagara Falls, has . been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet. The stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous Flying Wallenda acrobat family is scheduled to be . shown live on the Discovery Channel on June 23. Wallenda and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the Grand Canyon. Trying conditions: Wallenda and his team use giant fans to recreate the wind speeds he is likely to encounter . One step at a time: The wire cable will stretch 1,200ft across part of the Grand Canyon . Preparations: Nik Wallenda walks on a practice wire with the Grand Canyon as his back drop, as he trains for the stunt . Although the . humid Florida heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting, the unpredictable winds that whip through the Grand Canyon have been challenging. To try to get a feel for dealing with them, Wallenda practiced walking on his wire cable as Tropical Storm Andrea battered the Gulf Coast. His team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as Wallenda walked on his hire wire. 'I'm . not scared of them,' he told the Santa Cruz Sentinel, as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him. Top of the world: Nik Wallenda walks on top of the ferris wheel at Santa Cruz broadwalk in 2011 . Dream: The member of the Flying Wallenda act achieved his childhood wish of crossing Niagara Falls last year . Stunt: Nik Wallenda crosses a wire to entertain crowds at the Nascar spring cup series in North Carolina . 'I have to respect it, but I would never do what I do if I . was scared,' he said. Wallenda, who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the Grand Canyon for years, says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking. 'Once I get on that wire I get very peaceful ...  I look down and look at my surroundings, I hear crowds, I hear people in the audience.' Since his first wire walk at the age of four, Wallenda he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole. His first experience on a wire came before he was even born, when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant. In the final moments before starting one of his walks, he prays, then hugs his wife and three children, telling them he will see them in a few minutes. 'The first couple of steps are the hardest, so there's a lot of anticipation,' Wallenda, who proposed to his wife Erendira as they performed 30ft above crowds in Montreal, Canada, said. Legend: Karl Wallenda, Nik's great grandfather and source of inspiration, crosses the Tallulah Gorge in 1970 . Family act: Nik Wallenda and his sister Lijana learned to sky walk from a young age . He added: 'The hard part about doing live TV is waiting till the director says go.' The wire walker, who has written about his feats in his book Balance, uses a specially made cable, more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats. His balance pole, which weights 43lb, is a vital piece of equipment, increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground. Despite his positive thinking and training however, Wallenda is well aware of the dangers of the stunt. His great-grandfather and legendary sky walker, Karl Wallenda, fell to his death at the age of 73, during a hire wire walk in Puerto Rico in 1978. The legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for Wallenda, who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four. His grandfather's belief that 'Life is on the wire, everything else is just waiting,' has stayed with Wallenda since childhood, and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats. Focused: Nik Wallenda says when he steps on the wire he feels calm and relaxed - even over a 1,300ft drop . The televised sky walk over Niagara last year was watched by more than 13 million Americans on ABC. However, the safety clause in the network's contract meant Wallenda had to wear a harness. 'It was my dream to walk over Niagara Falls since I was about 5 or 6 years old, but part of that dream was taken away because I had to wear that harness,' he said. 'The exciting thing about this event is that I will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever.'

It might sound like a nightmare scenario from a science fiction film, but one expert has claimed that China is planning on transforming the moon into a missile base. The expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth. The alleged plans have been likened to the creation of the Death Star in the Star Wars films, a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a huge army led by Darth Vader. Comparisons of China's alleged plans have been drawn with the Death Star in the Star Wars films (pictured), which is a fictional space station capable of destroying planets with its giant laser and home to a super army led by Darth Vader . The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People’s Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. One expert told the newspaper that the Earth’s natural satellite could be turned into a giant weapon, which could be used as a military base where missiles could be directed at targets on Earth, Want China Times reported. The English news website  compared the alleged plans to the building of the Death Star in Star Wars. The expert reportedly told the website that weapons testing sites could be set up on the moon but also that the Earth's satellite could become a base used to send crafts out to deep space. Earlier this week China launched its March-3B rocket carrying the Chang'e-3 lunar rover, which is known as Jade Rabbit and plans to send its first astronaut to the moon by 2030. The country hopes it will become the first country in almost 40 years to soft-land a probe on the moon. The Beijing Times reported that discussions are ongoing in China as to whether the People's Liberation Army could establish a missile base on the moon. Here, soldiers watch the live broadcast of the lift-off of the Long March-3B carrier rocket carrying China's Chang'e-3 lunar probe on December 2, 2013 in Jinan, China . The nation is only the third in history to launch an unmanned lunar probe after the Chang'e-3 device, nicknamed 'Jade Rabbit' after a Chinese folklore character, set off at 5.30pm on Sunday evening (1.30am local time). The lunar probe blasted off on board an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China's southwestern Sichuan province. The probe, which can climb inclines of up to 30 degrees and travel up to 200 metres per hour, is targeted to land within a huge volcanic crater known as Sinus Iridum, which means the Bay of Rainbows, on about December 14. The mission is a huge step forward for its ambitious space programme and forms part of a plan in which China hopes to build a permanent lunar base in order to launch future missions to Mars within the next 15 years. An expert, from the China National Space Administration's Lunar Exploration Programme Centre, told a Chinese newspaper that the moon could be used as a military base from which to fire missiles at the Earth . President Xi Jinping has said he wants China to establish itself as a space superpower, and the mission has inspired widespread pride in China's growing technological prowess. State television showed a live broadcast of the rocket lifting off. If all goes smoothly, the rover will conduct geological surveys and search for natural resources after the probe touches down on the moon in mid-December. It is designed to roam the lunar surface for at least 90 Earth days – three Lunar days – covering an area of about five square kilometres. It will send probes beneath the surface as well as taking high-resolution images of the rock, a flat area formed from the molten basalt released by lunar volcanoes several billion years ago. The journey of the probe and its final landing is being closely monitored by the European Space Agency (ESA), which is cooperating closely with China.

"By . Ian Drury for the Daily Mail . Britain may need to introduce controversial privacy laws to meet the ‘challenges’ thrown up by lightning-fast internet communications, Britain’s most senior judge has said. Lord Neuberger, who is the president of the Supreme Court, said it was time to re-think the law because information spread quickly around the globe via social media including Facebook and Twitter. His comments were interpreted as a first step towards legislating to protect people’s privacy – which critics warn would hinder the Press’s ability to investigate and expose corruption and wrong-doing. Lord Neuberger, , pictured, said the speed of new technology means we may need  to consider a privacy law . Britain has no single privacy law, unlike many other European countries. But UK judges have been accused of introducing a privacy law never debated or considered by Parliament, based only on the Human Rights Act – which contains a ‘right to private and family life’ – and their own successive judgments. The process began when law lords ruled it was wrong for a newspaper to have pictured model Naomi Campbell going to a drug rehabilitation clinic. In a speech in Hong Kong, Lord Neuberger said there had been ‘astonishing developments in IT – the ease with which information can be transmitted and received across the world, the ease with which words and scenes can be clandestinely recorded, and the ease with which information can be misrepresented or doctored.’ Media lawyer Mark Stephens said a privacy law enables 'scallywags and scoundrels' to hide their wrongdoing . He said: ‘These developments may make it inevitable that the law on privacy, indeed, the law relating to communications generally, may have to be reconsidered.’ He also gave a new interpretation on the ‘law on privacy’ in England and Wales, saying: ‘If I want to do or say something which I am only prepared to do or say privately, then it is an interference with my freedom of expression, if I cannot do it or say it because it will be reported in a newspaper.’ But Mark Stephens, a leading media lawyer, said Lord Neuberger’s intervention could be the first step towards a new privacy law in this country. He said: ’I think we can say without fear of contradiction that this is a first indication of new government policy on privacy. ‘This is very controversial. There is always a debate about whether scallywags and scoundrels use privacy laws to conceal their wrongdoing.’",GPT-4,"This article discusses potential legislative changes in the United Kingdom as hinted by a prominent judiciary figure, Lord Neuberger. It explores the contemporary context in which rapid advancements in technology and communication means, such as social media platforms, online interactions, and data dissemination, raises unprecedented legal and ethical considerations. The discourse revolves around balancing individual privacy rights with public interests and broader implications for press freedom. The article also quotes other legal experts presenting contrasting viewpoints on the subject matter.","Supreme Court President, Lord Neuberger, suggests UK may need privacy laws due to the rapid speed of information dissemination via social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Media lawyer Mark Stephens interprets this as evidence of a policy shift, while warning that such laws could allow 'scallywags and scoundrels' to evade exposure. The story addresses UK's lack of definitive privacy laws compared to other European countries, and criticisms of judges 'creating' laws based on Human Rights Act.","Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, hints at UK potentially necessitating privacy laws in response to the swift global spread of information via social networks like Facebook and Twitter.

"Three quarters of sunbeds have failed safety tests in undercover checks by officials. Salons are using beds three times as hot as the Australian outback – putting unsuspecting clients at risk of serious skin conditions such as cancer. In the worst cases, sunbeds breached the legal limit by as much as three times, emitting UV rays too hot to ever occur on earth. Many salons are using sunbeds three times as hot as the Australian Outback - putting users at risk of skin cancer - an investigation by Trading Standards has revealed . Tanning salons, hairdressers and nail bars with sunbeds caused the most concern, while sunbeds in gyms were found to have much higher levels of compliance. Now, even the tanning industry has joined calls for tougher action against rogue operators. The latest shock figures come from North Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department - but there are fears the problem could be nationwide. The report revealed that 75 per cent of sunbeds failed to meet the legal limit for an acceptable level of UV radiation. Undercover officers found sunbeds emitting radiation at between 1.5 and 2.5 times the legal limit - a level hotter than the sun in the Australian Outback. The investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot. It involved Trading Standards officers donning protective radiation suits to check UV levels. Tests carried out earlier this year in West Yorkshire found 89 per cent of beds failed to meet the legal safety limit. Lamps in sunbeds can use a level of UV no more powerful than the legal limit of 0.3 watts per square metre, which is the equivalent of the sun on a hot day in Spain. However, investigations in Wakefield, Bradford, Kirklees, Leeds, and Calderdale revealed some sunbeds were belting out 0.9 watts per square metre, a level of solar energy too hot ever to be found on earth. Some beds were pumping out 0.9 watts per square metre, three times the legal limit and a level of UV radiation too hot ever to be found on earth . Similarly, an inspection of all the sunbeds in North Tyneside carried out in March  found that eight out of 10 sunbed salons failed to comply with the rules. The average level of radiation they found was 0.49 watts per square metre, with at least one bed emitting 1.18 watts. Officials underlined that while 0.3 watts can be compared with a hot day on the beach in the Mediterranean, 0.9 watts is completely off the scale. The Trading Standards investigation began after complaints from customers that the tanning beds were too hot . Clare Forbes, of West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards department said: 'Such levels of UV radiation do not occur anywhere on the earth's surface. Not even 0.6 occurs anywhere on earth.' A Trading Standards officer for North Yorkshire County council said the beds that failed the tests were all suspended from use until the bulbs were repaired or replaced. Officers will now expand the survey to cover the whole county. They added: 'As we move into autumn officers warned people who may be tempted to use sunbeds to maintain their holiday tan, that they may be risking serious skin damage and worse.' Gary Lipman, Chairman of The Sunbed Association, joined in calls for further regulation to keep the public safe. He said: 'We welcome North Yorkshire County Council's efforts to ensure sunbed businesses are operating within the law. 'Our Code of Practice requires our members to operate to best practise but beyond our membership we are aware that not all tanning businesses operate to such high standards. 'We very much hope that now these tests have been taken, the Council uses its powers to ensure compliance, so that all sunbed businesses are operating on a level playing field. 'Only the local authority has the powers to ensure compliance and where this is properly enforced across the board, experience dictates that the vast majority of salons comply. 'We would encourage the Council to take swift action against any salon that resists compliance. 'We would always recommend that anyone looking to use a sunbed, seeks out a member of The Sunbed Association, where they are assured of receiving correct advice and information from properly trained staff about responsible tanning.'",GPT-4,"This article discusses an investigation surrounding sunbed safety conducted by official testers. The revelations indicate an alarming percentage of equipment failing to meet appropriate safety standards, potentially endangering consumers with oversized levels of harmful radiation. The information detailed in the article is the result of undercover checks and involves a wide array of businesses, from tanning salons to gyms. The narrative further delves into calls for regulatory enhancements within the light-emitting services industry, underscoring the urgent public health implications.","North and West Yorkshire County Council's Trading Standards discovered 75% of sunbeds in salons, hairdressers, and nail bars in North Tyneside, emitting dangerous levels of UV radiation, akin to Australia's outback, posing a skin cancer risk. Officers in radiation suits carried out checks in response to customer complaints. Even though gyms showed more compliance, Trading Standards and The Sunbed Association urged stricter regulations. Sunbeds were recorded emitting up to 0.9 and 1.18 watts, far above Spain's Mediterranean standard of 0.3 watts per square metre.","Trading Standards in North and West Yorkshire found 75% of sunbeds at salons, nail bars, and hairdressers, notably in North Tyneside, breaching safety with UV levels up to three times the 0.3 watts limit, equivalent to a hot day in Spain, prompting skin cancer risk warnings. Inspections followed customer complaints about excessive heat. Gyms demonstrated greater compliance. Calls for stricter regulations have been voiced by The Sunbed Association. Non-compliant sunbeds showed worrying 0.9 and 1.18 watts readings.","Undercover investigations by North and West Yorkshire Trading Standards revealed 75% of checked sunbeds at salons, nail bars, and hairdressers in regions including North Tyneside, breached safety limits, emitting UV radiation up to 2.5 times over the 0.3 watts limit, roughly equivalent to Spanish summer sun intensity, raising skin cancer concerns.

"(CNN) -- It was the first tie out -- and it's the tie everyone is talking about. Manchester City will face Barcelona in the last 16 of the European Champions League in what promises to be one of the most eagerly awaited contests in this year's competition. City, which has been in irrepressible form at home in the English Premier League and won at defending champion Bayern Munich last week, had failed to reach this stage in each of its previous two attempts. Now it will face a Barcelona side which has won the tournament on four occasions -- but director of football Txixi Beguiristain says City will not fear his former club. ""I think it will be a great match,"" he told City's official website. ""Ours is a team with a lot of confidence especially after winning against the champions in Munich -- that will give us a lot of confidence. Not just at home but away as well. ""We have to be confident because of the way we are playing. We are showing that we can score in all matches. This is important in the Champions League. ""We scored in Plzen, in Moscow, in Munich -- it should give us confidence to play against a team who have been champions many times. ""Our manager knows Barcelona perfectly because he managed in Spain for a long time. In this sense, we are confident. ""I think the text messages will be flying between Manchester and Barcelona now between Sergio and Lionel! If you want to win the Champions League you have to beat the biggest teams, Barcelona are one of the biggest teams."" City has spent the past few years modeling itself on Barcelona -- now it is aiming to supplant it in Europe's top club competition. Under the management of Manuel Pellegrini, the former Villarreal and Real Madrid coach, City has progressed to the last 16 of the competition for the very first time. Backed by the riches of Sheikh Mansour, the deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, City has used its financial muscle to lure those who enjoyed great success at Barcelona. Beguiristain worked at the Camp Nou from 2003-10 before joining City to work alongside Ferran Soriano, who joined following a spell with the Catalan club as vice-president. Only last January, Barcelona president Sandro Rosell accused City of trying to poach players and coaching staff from the Camp Nou. One former Barcelona player who is expected to star for City is Yaya Toure -- the midfielder who left for England in July 2010. The contest will also see City's Argentine striker Sergio Aguero, who will hope to have recovered from a calf injury after being ruled out for up to a month, go up against international teammate Lionel Messi. And while neutrals will be salivating at the prospect of the two heavyweight giants going head-to-head, Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino says both teams would have rather avoided one another. ""City will not have wanted to play against Barcelona either,"" he told reporters. ""What we need to concentrate on is being in good shape when February comes around. We need to have a high level and sustain it. ""They are scoring goals with ease so we are not going to discover them now. We want to play well in the tie and obviously win it."" Elsewhere, defending champion Bayern Munich will take on Arsenal in a repeat of last season's clash at the same stage. Bayern triumphed 3-1 in north London before squeaking through to the quarterfinals on away goals following a 2-0 home defeat. Arsenal, which sits top of the Premier League despite Saturday's 6-3 defeat at Manchester City, will provide a tough test for Bayern, according to chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. ""They are the leaders in the Premier League and so we have been warned,"" he told reporters. ""A few months ago we lost to them in Munich. They are a very tough team."" In 2012, Didier Drogba struck the winning penalty as Chelsea pulled off an unlikely Champions League triumph by defeating Bayern in the final in Munich. Now at Galatasaray, Drogba will return to Stamford Bridge to face his beloved Blues in what promises to be an emotional reunion. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho had predicted that his side would be paired with the Turkish club, which defeated Juventus in a dramatic final group game to seal its place in the last 16. Real Madrid has been paired with German side Schalke, with Carlo Ancelotti's men still harboring ambitions of winning ""La Decima"" -- the club's 10th title. Real, which sits third in Spain, has not won the competition since 2002 and was beaten by Borussia Dortmund in last year's semifinal. Dortmund, which was beaten in last season's final by Bayern, will travel to Russia to take on Zenit St Petersburg in the first leg. Manchester United will be favorite to progress to the quarterfinal stage after being paired with Greek side Olympiakos. David Moyes' side, which finished top of its group despite unconvincing domestic form, last won the competition in 2008. Seven-time winner AC Milan has been handed a testing tie against Atletico Madrid.

"Bosses of nuisance call companies could be hit with £500,000 fines in a Government crackdown on unwanted calls and texts. Up to one billion cold calls are received by British families each year leaving many elderly people 'too scared to answer the phone', ministers said. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said nuisance calls were a 'plague' on families and had to stop. Ministers want to to impose tougher regulation on call centres amid growing public anger at the nuisance calls . The Government's Nuisance Calls Task Force said new rules should be introduced to make company bosses  responsible for cold-callers causing ‘severe distress’ to families. Under the plan, Payment Protection Insurance cold-callers could face fines of up to 20 per cent of their annual turnover. Which? executive director and taskforce chairman Richard Lloyd said many British firms were ‘breaking the law’. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the way in which the law was enforced had not been good enough. Mr Lloyd said the trade in personal data, responsible for the vast majority of nuisance calls, was ‘out of control’. He also called on regulators to clamp down on the abuse of existing legislation. ‘We want to see business with good reputations that aren't keeping a close enough eye on this making sure that there is someone senior on their board who will be held to account if those nuisance calls are being generated by that businesses activity,’ Mr Lloyd said. Between April and June this year, 40,000 people complained to the Information Commissioner about unwanted live or automated calls to their phones. Most focused on accident or PPI claims, as well as some debt consolidation company calls. The Nuisance Call Task Force said many consumers did not know that they had unwittingly given their consent to be contacted by these companies. Conservative MP Ed Vaizey, the Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy, said nuisance calls were a 'plague' Mr Vaizey said: ‘For too long, nuisance calls have plagued consumers, often at very inconvenient times of the day and in some cases, leaving vulnerable people like the elderly too scared to answer the phone. ‘That's why we're determined to tackle this scourge through the first-ever nuisance calls action plan. ‘We've already made progress, including making it easier for Ofcom to share information with the ICO about companies breaking the rules, and we're currently looking at lowering or removing the legal threshold before firms could be hit with fines of up to £500,000.’",GPT-4,"The present article explores the topic of governmental regulations regarding communication practices, with a particular focus on policies aiming to mitigate the impact of certain commercial behaviours perceived as nuisances.

"Our galaxy can be a very dusty place, and supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a supernova's dust‐making capabilities. The little evidence astronomers did have could not account for the massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. Now new images of the famed Supernova 1987A have, for the first time, captured the remains of the exploding star brimming with freshly formed dust. This artist's illustration shows Supernova 1987A, based on real data with the cold, inner regions of the exploded star's remnants (in red) where tremendous  amounts of dust were detected and imaged. This inner region is contrasted with the outer shell (lacy white and blue circles), where the blast wave from the supernova is colliding with the envelope of gas ejected  from the star prior to its powerful detonation . If enough of this dust makes the perilous transition into interstellar space, it could explain how many galaxies acquired their dusty, dusky appearance. ‘We have found a remarkably large dust mass concentrated in the central part of the ejecta from a relatively young and nearby supernova,’ said Remy Indebetouw, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville. ‘This is the first time we've been able to really image where the dust has formed, which is important in understanding the evolution of galaxies.’ An international team of astronomers used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope to observe the glowing remains of Supernova 1987A. This image shows the remnant of Supernova 1987A  in light of very different wavelengths. The ALMA Telescope data (in red) shows newly formed dust in the centre of the remnant as Hubble (in green) and Chandra (in blue) data show the expanding shock wave . In February of 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star. In fact they weren’t watching the beginnings of a star but the end of one and the brightest supernova seen from Earth in the four centuries since the telescope was invented. By the next morning news of the discovery had spread across the globe and southern hemisphere stargazers began watching the aftermath of this enormous stellar explosion, known as a supernova. In the two and a half decades since then, the remnant of Supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for researchers around the world, providing a wealth of information about one of the Universe’s most extreme events. Located more than 160,000 light years away, the light of the catastrophic explosion only reached Earth in February 1987. Before it exploded, the star generated huge amounts of gas, including a thick, dense, clumpy ring more than a light year across. Astronomers predicted that as the gas cooled after the explosion, large amounts of dust would form as atoms of oxygen, carbon, and silicon bonded together in the cold central regions of the remnant. However, earlier observations of SN 1987A with infrared telescopes, made during the first 500 days after the explosion, detected only a small amount of hot dust. Using, the research team was able to image the far more abundant cold dust, which glows brightly in millimetre and submillimetre light. The astronomers estimate that the remnant now contains about 25 per cent the mass of the sun in newly formed dust. They also found that significant amounts of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide have formed. ‘SN 1987A is a special place since it hasn't mixed with the surrounding environment, so what we see there was made there,’ said Dr Indebetouw. ‘The new ALMA results, which are the first of their kind, reveal a supernova remnant chock full of material that simply did not exist a few decades ago.’ Supernovae, however, can both create and destroy dust grains. As the shockwave from the initial explosion radiated out into space, it produced bright glowing rings of material, as seen in earlier observations with the Hubble Telescope. After hitting this envelope of gas, which . was sloughed off by the progenitor red giant star as it neared the end . of its life, a portion of this powerful explosion rebounded back towards . the centre of the remnant. Last year, a team of astronomers led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) produced incredible high resolution radio images of the expanding SN 1987A remnant at millimetre wavelengths. In this image contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a Hubble space telescope image of Supernova 1987A combined to provide a unique view of its death throes . Cosmic dust consists of tiny particles of solid material floating around in the space between the stars. Unlike the dust you find in your house, it is more like smoke with small particles varying from collections of just a few molecules to grains of 0.1 mm in size. D . It helps stars form, and it is also the raw material from which planets like the Earth are created. Supernovae are thought to be a main source of that dust - especially in the early universe. But . up until now, there has been very little direct evidence of a . supernova's dust‐making capabilities, and could not account for the . massive amount of dust detected in young, distant galaxies. ‘At some point, this rebound shockwave will slam into these billowing clumps of freshly minted dust,’ said Dr Indebetouw. ‘It's likely that some fraction of the dust will be blasted apart at that point. It's hard to predict exactly how much — maybe only a little, possibly a half or two thirds.’ If a good fraction survives and makes it into interstellar space, it could account for the copious dust astronomers detect in the early universe. ‘Really early galaxies are incredibly dusty and this dust plays a major role in the evolution of galaxies,’ added Mikako Matsuura of University College London, UK. ‘Today we know dust can be created in several ways, but in the early universe most of it must have come from supernovae. We finally have direct evidence to support that theory.’ In 1987 astronomers observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the sudden appearance of what looked like a new star.

"Famous Italian designers like Fendi, Gucci and Prada may be toted by celebrities such as Rihanna, Kate Moss and Katy Perry, but few are probably aware of the history behind the brands they wear. A new book has now archived the changing face of Italian fashion, from the post-war years to the 21st century. Italian Glamour: The Essence of Italian Fashion, From the Postwar Years to the Present Day, captures the evolution of Mediterranean style through 300 iconic dresses and archived images. Model Joan Olsen (left) shows off bold linear prints in an outfit by haute couture designer/artist Livio de Simone in 1954. Co-author Enrico says that Italian glamour is not 'sophisticated or artificial' The book was compiled by Enrico Quinto and Paolo Tinarelli - the two men who  were the first to introduce the concept of vintage style in Italy . The volume has been compiled by Enrico Quinto, 51, and Paolo Tinarelli, 49. The two men established the first flea market in Rome and were the first to introduce the concept of vintage in Italy. Enrico revealed that they wanted to honour the Italian designers who have helped to make the country a fashion powerhouse. He said: 'The pioneers that have really put Italy on the map of international fashion have been Emilio Pucci in the Fifties, Missoni and Krizia in the Sixties, Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace in the Seventies and Eighties, and Dolce & Gabbana, Prada and Gucci in the Nineties.' Fifties cover girl Ivy Nicholson wears Emilio Pucci in Capri, 1953. The book talks about how the start of many Italian fashion powerhouses started out with a real focus on craftsmanship . The book focuses on the humble beginnings of some of the world's biggest Italian brands and how they rose to cultural significance. It  looks at how designers such as Miuccia Prada, Giorgio Armani and Adele Casagrande, founder of Fendi, have created a legacy within their labels. Many Italian powerhouses started out with a focus on craftsmanship, using work methods and decorative traditions that were passed down through generations. Post-war economic development in the fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers such as Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with a patchwork of ideas and activities . The book also explores momentous periods which truly characterised Italian fashion. For example, post-war economic development in the Fifties saw the expansion of the advertising industry into high fashion. Designers like Alma Maria Lami constructed clothes that were decorated with patchworks of cartoon-like ideas and activities, which subtly influenced buyers.

In the mid-fifties, Emilio Frederico Schuberth created an outfit which had a removable over-skirt so that the wearer could opt for a straight or flared silhouette . Another poignant moment came in the mid-Fifties, where Italian fashion began to break away from what Parisian style dictated. Creative directors such as Emilio Frederico Schuberth began to create structurally innovative creations. Italian Glamour also looks at breakthrough moments for Italian fashion, such as one of the first runway showcases in Florence, which saw the artistic city overtake Paris as the global fashion capital. From that moment on, styles quickly progressed. By the mid-Forties, Italian designers began to take their inspiration from Hollywood femme fatales rather than Parisian fashion. Religion was also an inspiration, which explains the high-necks and dark tones often seen in that period.

In fact, Parisian fashion soon began to follow the lead of Italian innovators. Germana Marucelli was the first Italian post-war designer, and her designs were, on several occasions, interpreted by Frenchman Christian Dior. The book also examines how trends developed over the years and iconic celebrity moments that would cement a designer's fame. One in particular came in 1956, when Italian-French film star Sophia Loren wore a sweeping gown by Emilio Schuberth at the Cannes Festival. Schuberth became known as the 'tailor to the stars', and also catered for the likes of Rita Hayworth and Brigitte Bardot. His students included Valentino Garavani - who continues to be an Italian powerhouse today.

From the mid-Sixties, Karl Lagerfeld was involved in the design of Fendi's logo with the interlocking F letters. Several designers in the book, such as Federico Forquet, are no longer operational, but were important in influencing and shaping the overall movement and progression of Italian fashion. The book also highlights how certain Italian designers, such as Roberto Carpucci, were propelled to fame when clothes were featured in advertorials - eventually appearing in publications such as Vogue. A piece from Italian designer Federico Forquet, in his autumn/winter 1965 collection . Renowned Italian designer, Roberto Carpucci's structural designs featured in Vogue Italia in 1982 . A defining moment for Italian fashion was circa 1994; Elizabeth Hurley stepped out in a Versace safety pin gown that was to become one of the most iconic dresses of all time. From then on, it seemed that Italian fashion was the pinnacle of daring style. Co-author of the book, Enrico Quinto says that Italian glamour is 'in the DNA of an Italian's lifestyle'. He adds: 'Italian glamour is not sophisticated or artificial; it keeps conscious of the female's body, and it works in the same way as the idea of 'Dolce Far Niente' - the sweetness of doing nothing. It's an accessible beauty - simple and natural.' Elizabeth Hurley in 1994 (left), pictured with then-beau, Hugh Grant (right) wearing the Versace dress that would go down in fashion history . Liz Hurley's dress (pictured) was a creation from Gianni Versace's spring/summer 1994 collection . In fact, Italian style has made a huge contribution to the fashion industry today, with Milan Fashion Week still a crucial part of the circuit, and with young models such as Kendall Jenner flocking to Milan every year. Popular culture figures such as Rihanna, are also active lovers of the Italian style. Rihanna recently customised a Fendi Baguette bag for a charity auction, along with Sarah Jessica Parker.

In terms of the state of Italian glamour now, Enrico argues that it is a changing landscape, but something that maintains its simplicity. 'Italy has become more global and the melting pot of different nationalities has automatically brought new influences into Italy's lifestyle. 'I believe that  the essence of Italian glamour is based on a certain 'minimalism'. Clothing still has to be practical and adapted to an understated lifestyle.

"UKIP leader has vowed to stand down as leader if the party fails to breakthrough in next year's election . Nigel Farage has vowed to resign as party leader if UKIP fails to achieve a general election breakthrough next year. The UKIP leader said there was ‘not one ounce of complacency from me’ after he was selected last night to stand in the South Thanet seat for UKIP at next year's general election. His nomination was overshadowed by Boris Johnson’s decision to throw his hat into the ring to be the next MP for Uxbridge in west London. But Mr Farage said he confident that the Tories would lose votes to UKIP at the next election. He said: ‘I'm not pretending for one moment that it's going to be easy, but Ukip is offering something different and distinctive. ‘If we'd failed in the European elections I would have stood down, if we fail next year the party will pick someone better than me, but do you know what? That ain't going to happen.’ Mr Farage meanwhile told The Telegraph that Mr Johnson will be a ‘problem’ for the Tories after the next election. He said: ‘He [Boris] will be a problem for the Conservatives. He will appeal to the Tory grassroots, and have that little certain something that Mr Cameron appears to be struggling with.’ Mr Farage added: ‘While Boris on a good day sounds fairly Eurosceptic, and says that we must do this, that, and the other, the reality is that this is the same Boris who advocated an amnesty for all of the illegal immigrants in London a Boris who on a tour of India last year said EU membership was vital to the British economy. ‘So yes, Boris Johnson is engaging, people like him, but in policy terms, certainly at the moment, he’s a long way from the position that our voters are really looking for.’ He said: ‘Ukip will be a force in the House of Commons next year and if we get this right we may find ourselves in a hung parliament holding the balance of power.’ Leaked polling suggested that UKIP will target seats on the east and south coast of England held by Tory MPs, including three government ministers. The revelation reignited fears among the Conservatives that a strong UKIP performance could split right-wing voters and help Ed Miliband into power. However, speaking after his selection, Mr Farage said that his party will target Labour too: ‘Somebody once said I was David Cameron's worst nightmare. Well that's not true, I want to be Ed Miliband's worst nightmare too. This idea that Ukip voters are all ex Tories is baloney.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson will be used by the Tories to undermine the appeal of Nigel Farage and UKIP in the next election . Mr Farage’s comments come as polls showed more voters welcome the return of Mr Johnson to Parliament than the prospect of UKIP winning seats next year. A survey by YouGov has found 57 per cent of the public believes the London mayor’s decision to return to Parliament is ‘good thing’. Two thirds also believe it is likely that he will one day lead the Conservative party.

"British scientists are calling for anorexia sufferers to join a ground-breaking study to find the genes that may cause the condition. Researchers from King’s College London have joined forces with experts from around the world in  an effort to prove that victims are born with the illness. Anorexia affects about 1.6 million people in Britain alone. Charlotte Bevan, who died in January, and her daughter Georgie who was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12 . In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King’s has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers. Their target is 25,000 DNA samples worldwide, including 1,000 volunteers from Britain. Brooks Newmark, the Minister for Civil Society, who last year revealed that he had suffered from anorexia, has already donated his DNA. The global project, called AN25K, was launched by Cynthia Bulik,  a professor in the field of eating disorders at the University of  North Carolina. After carrying out research into anorexia in twins in 2007, she discovered that the illness can be inherited, and that more than half the risk of developing the disorder is due to genetic factors. She said: ‘We know very little about the biology of anorexia and hopefully by identifying these genes we will be able to develop new treatments. It is not just one gene – it will be hundreds of genes.’ Ground-breaking: In the largest example of genetic research ever done into the eating disorder, King's has already analysed the DNA of more than  300 former anorexia sufferers . The UK research is backed by the charity Charlotte’s Helix, set up in memory of Charlotte Bevan, a farmer’s wife who died aged 48 in January. Her daughter Georgie was diagnosed with anorexia aged 12. Charlotte rapidly became aware of the stigma associated with the illness and was frustrated by the lack of scientific research being done. She was convinced that her daughter’s eating disorder was in her DNA and that Georgie had not chosen to be anorexic. After . being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Charlotte wrote a book on . anorexia designed to help parents. She also founded the charity to . collect the DNA of anorexia sufferers and fund research into the . illness. In . her book, Throwing Starfish Across The Sea, Charlotte wrote: ‘I want . people to stop being afraid  and ashamed of something that is not their . fault. I want to educate the 99 per cent of the world that don’t know or . don’t care that the eating disorder world deserves a voice. ‘I . want people to know that my daughter is not a vain, mindless bimbo who . just wants to be thin, but a stellar, brilliant, important part of the . community who just happens to have a brain blip.’ Gerome . Breen, a senior lecturer at King’s, is leading the AN25K project. He . said: ‘What we want to discover is are genetics and biology behind the . illness, because if we can find the biology behind the illness, we can . design specific treatments. We want to help sufferers survive.’ Erica Husain, a friend of Charlotte and chairman of the charity, said: ‘We knew we were going to keep this going for her. We wanted to find a way to carry research forward, to bring this research to the UK and put Charlotte’s name on it.’ She added: ‘There are still a lot of myths and tales and this is something  that can give us some reality, some science. People will then understand that an eating disorder is not an illness of choice.’ The research has been backed by Britain’s leading centre for eating disorders, the Eating Disorders Unit at the Bethlem Royal Hospital, which is part of South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. Janet Treasure, the unit’s director, said: ‘The research looking at interactions between genes and the environment is invaluable because it does take away a bit of the guilt and confusion from families who are dealing with eating disorders.’ Charlotte’s Helix has no government funding and relies on donations to pay for DNA samples to be taken.",GPT-4,"An article primarily revolving around a scientific endeavor, delving into complex issue of genetics and its possible links to certain health conditions.

"These unique photographs taken during the First World War by a British sailor show the biggest manmade explosion in history, when two warships crashed into one another, killing 2,000 people. The photos, taken by Royal Navy Lt Victor Magnus, have emerged nearly 100 years after they were taken and show the moment a French and Norwegian ship dramatically collided in what has become known as 'The Halifax Explosion'. During the incident, the SS Mont-Blanc - a ship from France fully loaded with wartime explosives - collided with SS Imo from Norway. The French ship then blew up, nearly wiping out an entire district.

Experts say the blast was the largest manmade explosion prior to the development of nuclear weapons - with an equivalent force of roughly 2.9 kilotons of TNT. Amateur photographer Victor, who was based in Halifax in the Canadian state of Nova Scotia, was said to 'always had a camera around his neck' and was able to grab a series of shots of the original 'big bang'. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, who discovered them among photo albums in a drawer. She had no idea a slice of history had been gathering dust in her home for nearly 100 years. Mrs Foreman, from Hayle in Cornwall, who served in the land army, will take them to the Imperial War Museum, London, next month to have the photos looked at. She said: 'My father was a great photographer. He always had a camera around his neck. He would take photos all the time. He never asked anyone to pose or anything. He just snapped away. 'It was just a coincidence that he was at the Halifax disaster. The actual explosion was a a massive amount of smoke.

He took some photos on the shore and it looked like the London Blitz. 'The whole situation of finding the photos has made it very real. I'm just so proud of him. He never talked about this and this is the first time seeing them. It's extraordinary.' After the war, Victor went back to his job as a Marine Underwriter in Essex, before serving in the home guard during the Second World War. Although later leaving the role to become an apple farmer, he always loved the sea and was the Commodore of Essex Yacht Club. He was married for his whole life, had three children and six grandchildren, and died in 1969. The photos have now been found by his daughter Ann Foreman, 89, from Hayle, Cornwall, who discovered them among photo albums . The explosion, at 9.04am on Thursday December 6, 1917, happened in the the Narrows, a strait connecting the upper Halifax Harbour to Bedford Basin. A fire on board the French ship then ignited her explosive cargo causing a cataclysmic explosion that devastated the Richmond District of Halifax. It was so powerful it almost wiped out the entire town and around 2,000 people were killed by debris, fires, and collapsed buildings and more than 9,000 injured. 1.

There was a big push by the Germans to win the war. 'To try and stop this, the allies launched a convoy system with ships staying sailing close to each other. This left them vulnerable to collision. 'Secondly, so many ships had been sunk that ships that weren't right for the job were being used.

Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.' The November to January temperature outlooks indicate a warmer than normal season for both daytime and night-time temperatures across most of Australia. 'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott. 'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.' 'It's not unusual, it's the summer pattern arriving and we have a lot of moisture in the air,' said Ms Westcott. According to the Weather Bureau, this time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why Australians can experience very hot and cold in the same day . Up to 10,000 homes were blacked out by the fierce Newcastle storm on Sunday . The Bureau also states that 'the Pacific Ocean has shown some renewed signs of El Niño development in recent weeks'.

"By . Nick Fagge . PUBLISHED: . 09:46 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:10 EST, 28 May 2012 . Liverpool is the whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show huge regional variations in case rates – clear evidence of fraud in the eyes of industry experts. Whiplash claims cost insurers  £2billion a year, with bogus payouts adding £90 to the typical car insurance premium. Whiplash: Bogus claims cost the insurance industry £2¿billion a year and have raised the annual insurance premium for every motorist by £90 . In the 12 months to March, the number of cases in Liverpool was 22 per thousand residents. Uxbridge in West London and Oldham were close behind with 21 and 20 per thousand. Those figures are twice the national average of nine per thousand and 20 times the level seen in some areas. The lowest rates were in Scotland, where there are strict controls on referral fees paid to garages and insurance brokers in such cases. A survey of GPs last year showed that 25 per cent of the 550,000 annual claims are ‘fake or over-diagnosed’. At least 30,000 – 6 per cent – are outright fraudulent, according to the Insurance Fraud Bureau.UK insurers receive 1,200 whiplash claims a day, twice the level in other European countries. Malcolm Tarling, of the Association of British Insurers, said: ‘This is the first time there has been a regional breakdown of where whiplash claims are being made. ‘And there appears to be a striking correlation between whiplash victims and the number of lawyers specialising in personal injuries claims. ‘Whiplash claims have gone up by a third in the past three years while the number of accidents has gone down. ‘Either we have developed the weakest necks in Europe or drivers are regarding whiplash injury claims as easy money waiting to be collected.’ Aviva has called for a radical overhaul of the system, saying the compensation culture encourages bogus claims. Dominic Clayden, claims director for the insurer, said: ‘We operate in a legal system that encourages claimants to “have a go” – there is no financial risk for even the most minor whiplash claim to be brought. 'However, this “whip-cash” is not free. It is not coincidence that premiums have increased as whiplash claims have skyrocketed over recent years. ‘The UK needs urgent reform of the system so genuine claimants get the compensation and help they deserve, but minor incidents that hardly give rise to an injury are not penalising motorists through inflated premiums. Crackdown: The nationwide issue was brought to light by Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke who has held a 'Whiplash Summit' in Parliament in a bid to crack down on the crooks . ‘The Ministry of Justice needs to increase the small claims limit to £5,000, meaning that minor whiplash claims would not need to involve lawyers. We also believe that the damages paid for whiplash injuries need to be reduced and capped.’ But John Spencer, of personal injury specialist Spencer’s Solicitors, said: ‘There are some cases that are spurious and fraudulent and every professional legal firm wants to put a stop to that. ‘But you have got to make sure that people who are injured are properly compensated.’ Last night a Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Car insurance costs are simply too high, they must be reduced. ‘The Government has already taken tough action to ban referral fees, reform no win no fee rules and crack down on fraudulent whiplash claims. ‘But we must go further and by working together with drivers and the industry the Government is determined to bring some common sense back and get premiums down.’ Whiplash is caused when the head moves suddenly, damaging ligaments and tendons in the neck – a common injury in a car accident. However it is difficult to diagnose and doctors must rely on the patient’s description of their symptoms.",GPT-4,"This article discusses the intriguing patterns and statistics around compensation claims, particularly in the realm of whiplash, in different regions of Britain. It delves into the cost implications of these claims on the insurance industry and speculates on potential fraudulence.

"(CNN)Sophisticated, glamorous and spacious -- when the super-rich go house-hunting they are searching for something special. Real estate in London's swankier suburbs can catch a buyers' eye. Mayfair, Kensington and Chelsea have long been the stomping ground of the elite -- and are now welcoming a new wave of African investors. ""The Africans who are coming into London now are Africans who themselves have worked for their money,"" explains Bimpe Nkontchou, a British-Nigerian wealth manager based in London. ""They have grown in industry and are actually part of the exciting story of the African renaissance,"" she continues. ""It's bringing to London the best of the continent."" These investors are having a considerable impact on London's property market and they mainly come from just six countries: Nigeria, Ghana, Congo, Gabon, Cameroon and Senegal. Of these, Nigerians are splashing out the most cash when it comes to bricks and mortar in the British capital -- typically spending between $22 and $37 million on securing a property, according to luxury property agents Beauchamp Estates. Their research shows that over the past three years Africans have spent over $900 million on luxury residential property in London. ""The new international African is very well-traveled,"" explains Nkontchou. ""Educated in the U.S., UK and different parts of Europe their taste is definitely more modern and clean."" 'Safe-Haven' Owning a home in post codes like W1 or W8 -- around the corner from Kensington Palace -- means more than having a place to lay your head. These buildings are investments which are expected to gain even bigger value in the coming years. High-end auction house Sotheby's says that foreign investors see London as a ""safe haven""  for prime property investments, and ranks the city as the second most important hub for ultra high-net-worth homes. The only spot more important on the planet is New York City. For evidence that London still attracts high-end buyers, look no further than the sale of a penthouse in Mayfair which fetched $40 million earlier this year. Educated thinking . As well as an intelligent investment, many of the African buyers see these houses as a way of maintaining long standing cultural ties with London -- and it's here they want to send their children to school. Harrow, Eton, Cheltenham Ladies College are all among the list of respected institutions that teach the offspring of wealthy Africans. The Nigerian Embassy in London calculates that Nigerian nationals now spend over $446 million per year on fees, tutoring and accommodation at British schools and university. ""West African clients are very much driven by the need to educate their children,"" says Nkontchou. ""Education usually means putting the children on an international stage, and that's one reason why this is feeding into the demand for property in London."" Indeed, education industry experts ICEF Monitor say there were over 17,500 Nigerians studying in British universities in 2012  -- about 1,000 more than the 2009/10 academic session. And experts are expecting this trend to continue. ""Virtually all the transactions are for end use, not rental investment, which indicates that the African buyer market in London has significant room for growth,"" says Gary Hersham, director at Beauchamp Estates. ""African buyers or luxury tenants in London are currently where the Russians and Ukrainians were five years ago. They have the resources and desire to purchase or rental luxury homes in Prime Central London,"" he adds. ""It is going to be the African century.""More from Marketplace Africa .
